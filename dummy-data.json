(Jack) Mayer states that “Emotions operate two major levels; physical and psychological.  Dr. Maurice Elias on the other hand, says, “Emotions are human beings’ warning systems as to what is really going on around them.  In other words, they act as an indicator of how things are going on in one’s lives.

Prayer\n\nWhen all efforts to let go of negative emotions fails, then we can always resort to prayer.
