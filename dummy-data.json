They function and look like your average person, but once they’ve made their way into your life, havoc, chaos and sorrow are often the only things they have to offer you. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They enjoy latching onto happy, unsuspecting people, which is why some of the most genuine and kind folks often have to deal with toxic people the most. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five surprising reasons that you’re attracting toxic people in your life:</span>\n\n**You’re really good at listening**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who are really good at listening to what others have to say are always highly valued, especially in a world that has become so distracted by the technology at our fingertips. Toxic people will use this great quality of yours as a platform to hear themselves speak. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can talk for hours about themselves (and the negative way they see the world) without showing any interest in what </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have to say. They just like when others accept their view of the world as truth.</span>\n\n**You give people the time of day**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generosity is undoubtedly a great quality to have, but when it comes to toxic people, it can be highly detrimental. Generosity is something that toxic individuals seek out on a regular basis, simply because they know that they can take advantage of a person who will do anything for them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re likely to grab hold and not let go if you’re always at their beck and call. </span>\n\n**You have an easygoing nature**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easygoing people are fun to be around. They pretty much always keep their cool and are very good at diffusing uncomfortable situations with clever jests or kind words. They’re usually very patient and kind, a trait that stems from the inner peace that they’ve found. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately for these people, their inner peace is exactly what attracts toxic people, simply because they wish to disrupt it.</span>\n\n**You’re good at solving conflict, building bridges**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When arguments and feuds go unresolved, the bridge builder will go to great lengths to see the relationship mended. Many people love you for your ability to bring people together, and are often quite grateful. Toxic people love these types because they love to destroy bridges. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating drama and conflict between others is something they truly enjoy.</span>\n\n**You see humanity in a very positive light**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like to believe that most people see their fellow man as inherently good-natured and kind, just as I do. And I’d say that most people’s daily interactions with each other prove this to be true. However, every now and then we experience the dark side of folks. If you’re the type of person who has trouble finding the darkness in others, you could be inviting toxic people into your life without even realizing it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you put up with a crappy friend out of hope that they will change? Do you completely ignore their poor behavior and distasteful acts, choosing to hang out with them anyway? Maybe it’s time to re-evaluate your friendship.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.marcandangel.com/2015/08/16/7-surprising-reasons-youre-attracting-toxic-people/</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

Here are four different labels used by marketers that describe how the eggs were farmed:</span>\n\n \n\n- ****Caged: **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Held in confined cages as small as 67 square-inches, these hens usually never see daylight and eat a diet consisting of entirely soy or corn. In the United States, **[about 90 percent](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2016-03-23/1-egg-8-ways)**of eggs are from hens who spend their entire lives laying eggs in their dark cages.</span>**\n\n- **Cage-Free: **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confined to less than 1-square-foot of space, these hens have more space than caged hens, but are not completely ‘free.’ They usually live in crowded barns and have diet of only corn or soy.</span>\n\n- **Free-Range: **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With less than 2-square-feet for each hen, these birds have a bit more room than the previous two, but don’t live the life that “free-range” implies. Many of them live in darkness, eating only a corn or soy diet.</span>\n\n- **Pasture-Raised:**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having the most space of all the hens, these chickens reside in at least 108 square-feet each, eating a diet that consists of many different things, like bugs, feed, grass, worms and whatever else they happen across. They’re let outside early in the morning, and then called in just before the sun falls.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, **[one study](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2015/03/05/eggs-is-it-time-to-get-back-together-with-this-once-feared-food)** conducted at Pennsylvania State University found that pasture-raised hens laid healthier eggs. Healthier because they contained two times as much omega-3 fat, three times the vitamin D, four times more vitamin E, and about seven times more beta-carotene than hens consuming a traditional diet of corn and soy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of labeling is just the first step, however. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the four categories above, the next part is becoming familiar with third-party verifications, such as “organic,” “**[Non-GMO Project Verified](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/04/29/are-gmos-really-that-harmful-to-eat)**” and “Certified Humane.” These labels typically require higher standards and stricter regulation of operational procedures.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A third-party certification from a recognized and trustworthy organization [is] a literal seal of approval,” says Adele Douglass of **[Certified Humane](http://certifiedhumane.org/)**.</span>\n\nh/t [**US News**](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2016-07-25/whats-the-difference-between-pasture-raised-and-free-range-eggs)\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

In the United States, <strong><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2016-03-23/1-egg-8-ways\">about 90 percent</a> </strong>of eggs are from hens who spend their entire lives laying eggs in their dark cages.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Cage-Free: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confined to less than 1-square-foot of space, these hens have more space than caged hens, but are not completely ‘free.’ They usually live in crowded barns and have diet of only corn or soy.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Free-Range: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With less than 2-square-feet for each hen, these birds have a bit more room than the previous two, but don’t live the life that “free-range” implies. Many of them live in darkness, eating only a corn or soy diet.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Pasture-Raised:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having the most space of all the hens, these chickens reside in at least 108 square-feet each, eating a diet that consists of many different things, like bugs, feed, grass, worms and whatever else they happen across. They’re let outside early in the morning, and then called in just before the sun falls.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, <strong><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2015/03/05/eggs-is-it-time-to-get-back-together-with-this-once-feared-food\">one study</a></strong> conducted at Pennsylvania State University found that pasture-raised hens laid healthier eggs. Healthier because they contained two times as much omega-3 fat, three times the vitamin D, four times more vitamin E, and about seven times more beta-carotene than hens consuming a traditional diet of corn and soy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of labeling is just the first step, however. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the four categories above, the next part is becoming familiar with third-party verifications, such as “organic,” “<strong><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/04/29/are-gmos-really-that-harmful-to-eat\">Non-GMO Project Verified</a></strong>” and “Certified Humane.” These labels typically require higher standards and stricter regulation of operational procedures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;A third-party certification from a recognized and trustworthy organization [is] a literal seal of approval,&#8221; says Adele Douglass of <strong><a href=\"http://certifiedhumane.org/\">Certified Humane</a></strong>.</span></p>\n<p>h/t <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2016-07-25/whats-the-difference-between-pasture-raised-and-free-range-eggs\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>US News</strong></a></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

                "markdown": "\n \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you spot a narcissist when you see them? You might have come across one and not even realized it. Many of them are naturally charismatic and easy to get along with, at first. But after spending some amount of time with them, red flags start popping up everywhere. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it can be hard to notice them, because it’s not always what the narcissist </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but what the narcissist </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn’t</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do that should be alarming. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are six things that narcissists are not likely to do:</span>\n\n**They’ll never reveal the true version of themselves**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists operate under a guise of falsehood, projecting a specific image of themselves that they think people will be most attracted to. They like to manipulate their way into your life under the premise that they’ll be a benefit to you, but their true malicious selves eventually surface, and oftentimes it’s too late to remedy the situation.</span>\n\n**They’re not interested in creating ‘secure’ relationships**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the manipulation tactics of a narcissist to be working at 100 percent efficiency, they have to keep their relationships unstable and uncertain. They’re always working to make you feel on edge or unsure about the happenings of your life. If they can do this, it makes them feel superior to you. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They derive security from your insecurity.</span>\n\n**They will never accept full responsibility for their behavior**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember how narcissists like to keep you on edge? They like to keep you questioning reality so that whenever you call them out on their poor behavior, they can turn the entire thing around and make it seem like your fault. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re never to blame, but always involved oddly enough. </span>\n\n**They’ll never give up control**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists live by controlling the world around them, so when they’re unable to do so, they tend to become incredibly irritated and upset. As mentioned before, they gain their security from the insecurities of others, and a big part of that is so that they can control every aspect of the setting they currently find themselves in.</span>\n\n**They will never see anyone as an equal**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists have such inflated egos that they view themselves as the ultimate cream of the crop; no one can ever match up to their superiority as a person. They’re not keen on seeing others succeed or achieve in areas where they cannot, so they actively try to degrade and bring down any “rivals.” </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever it takes to be on top.</span>\n\n**They will never compliment others**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because narcissists see themselves as nothing short of God’s gift to mankind, they’re not about to start handing out compliments to just anyone. They expect the compliments to be flowing in the other direction, towards them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are blessed enough to be complemented by a narcissist, be skeptical about why they’re doing so.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

But after spending some amount of time with them, red flags start popping up everywhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it can be hard to notice them, because it’s not always what the narcissist </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but what the narcissist </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn’t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do that should be alarming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are six things that narcissists are not likely to do:</span></p>\n<p><b>They’ll never reveal the true version of themselves</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists operate under a guise of falsehood, projecting a specific image of themselves that they think people will be most attracted to. They like to manipulate their way into your life under the premise that they’ll be a benefit to you, but their true malicious selves eventually surface, and oftentimes it’s too late to remedy the situation.</span></p>\n<p><b>They’re not interested in creating ‘secure’ relationships</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the manipulation tactics of a narcissist to be working at 100 percent efficiency, they have to keep their relationships unstable and uncertain. They’re always working to make you feel on edge or unsure about the happenings of your life. If they can do this, it makes them feel superior to you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They derive security from your insecurity.</span></p>\n<p><b>They will never accept full responsibility for their behavior</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember how narcissists like to keep you on edge? They like to keep you questioning reality so that whenever you call them out on their poor behavior, they can turn the entire thing around and make it seem like your fault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re never to blame, but always involved oddly enough. </span></p>\n<p><b>They’ll never give up control</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists live by controlling the world around them, so when they’re unable to do so, they tend to become incredibly irritated and upset. As mentioned before, they gain their security from the insecurities of others, and a big part of that is so that they can control every aspect of the setting they currently find themselves in.</span></p>\n<p><b>They will never see anyone as an equal</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists have such inflated egos that they view themselves as the ultimate cream of the crop; no one can ever match up to their superiority as a person. They’re not keen on seeing others succeed or achieve in areas where they cannot, so they actively try to degrade and bring down any “rivals.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever it takes to be on top.</span></p>\n<p><b>They will never compliment others</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because narcissists see themselves as nothing short of God’s gift to mankind, they’re not about to start handing out compliments to just anyone. They expect the compliments to be flowing in the other direction, towards them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are blessed enough to be complemented by a narcissist, be skeptical about why they’re doing so.</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

There’s a large difference between being a person who intimidates people and having a personality that people perceive as intimidating. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rude, domineering, crass.. These are all words that people use to describe people with strong personality types. While I can’t speak for everyone, I can say that most strong personality types that get labeled this way don’t understand it, because on the inside, they’re big softies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only difference between them everyone else is that they’re completely self-reliant when it comes to validation, they aren’t super competitive, and they’re not about to let anyone mistake them for a pushover.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound familiar? Here are five signs that you have a strong, or “intimidating” personality type:</span>\n\n**You don’t have time for excuses**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As people who strive to do their best and accomplish their goals by overcoming the obstacles that are before them, strong personalities are entirely uninterested in excuses. They hate hearing people whine, because they know that energy could be better spent figuring out how to achieve. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While others are worrying about all of the reasons they </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can’t</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do something, you’re focused on all of the ways you </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n**You’re highly selective when it comes to letting people in**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong people are very sure that they can handle anything life throws their way. This means that their validation and self-confidence comes from within. When you’re not interested in people telling you how to live your life, who you are and what you’re capable of, you start to do all of that for yourself. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once this happens, the need for significant others, best friends, family, coworkers, etc. starts to wane, simply because you don’t need anyone but yourself.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weaker personality types like having others around to make their lives feel validated. They like having people constantly reaffirming their life choices. You recognize that you’re not this way, but that others might need it, and that’s totally fine with you. </span>\n\n**Attention is something you could do without**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some might think you adore having the spotlight on yourself, they couldn’t be more wrong. The truth is that strong personalities are naturally magnetic, they attract people. Usually because others need a strong personality type to lean on. They want to have you around.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, don’t be afraid to say no to social invitations. You need downtime to recharge and rejuvenate just like everyone else. Make sure your needs are being met, just as you are helping others’ needs to be met.</span>\n\n**You view ‘fear’ differently**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people probably see you as a fearless person, and you’ll let them believe that, because while you definitely feel fear in certain situations, you never let it stop you from moving forward. That is the big difference that people often fail to recognize. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re not going to let fear run your life; you’re going to feel that fear and then use it as fuel.</span>\n\n**You cannot tolerate intolerant people**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong personality types hate being thought of as domineering because they know that domineering personalities are born from lack of knowledge or education. Strong people are the opposite of that. They enjoy using their brains and often think of themselves are fairly intellectual beings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it makes sense that they absolutely cannot stand people who make instantaneous judgments or criticisms on subjects that they have </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zero</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> experience with. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t talk just to hear yourself talk, so unless you have something important to add to the conversation, you’re not going to.

Your Zodiac Sign Tells All</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn More About How You Fall in Love, Based on Your Zodiac Sign</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falling in love is different for everyone, and our zodiac signs have a lot to do with how it happens. It makes sense though, doesn’t it? The universe will always influence who we are as people. Just as the Cancer will always be loving and caring, and the Leo proud and passionate.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking to find love, learning a bit about what your sign desires in a partner might just be the difference between a lasting, loving relationship, and a drama-filled nightmare.</span>\n\n\n## **Aries (March 21-April 19)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a youthful fire sign, Aries have a fervent energy and enthusiasm for life. Your leadership skills often let you control the flow of any relationship, which is good because you’re usually the one who is down-to-earth and level-headed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try not to put the cart before the horse, and people will flock to your ever burning flame.</span>\n\n\n## **Taurus (April 20-May 20)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taurus have a weak spot for physical intimacy. When the physical side of a relationship picks up heavy and fast, you’re likely to start falling in love at the same time. This is largely because of how in tune you are sensually with your body.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you do find yourself in a faithful relationship, you’re happy just ebbing and flowing within it. Which is why your dream is to settle down together somewhere remote and secluded.</span>\n\n\n## **Gemini (May 21-June 20)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart, funny and always looking on the bright side, Gemini always make great partners. They’re full of unique and intelligent ideas. They’re also incredibly romantic, which means they often fall in love and stay in love when they adore their partner. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might want nothing more than to be with your significant other 24/7, it is good to remember to give each other space, and to communicate with each other as much as possible.</span>\n\n\n## **Cancer (June 21-July 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Cancers tend to fall face first into love (and hard), they keep a bit of reserved skepticism. You’re searching for someone who will be your ‘partner,’ in every sense of the word. Which is why they prefer partners who are ambitious and motivated.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found a partner, you’re their number one fan. And your superb listening skills and sense of humor will keep them around for years to come.</span>\n\n\n## **Leo (July 23-August 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Leos are so charismatic, confident and warm, they rarely struggle to find love. But there natural ability to attract others doesn’t keep them from being completely loyal once they’ve fallen for someone. And they tend to fall in love often, and hard. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Leo, you are naturally territorial, but it’s only because of how intense your love is. You need a bit of praise and adoration here and there to keep you happy.</span>\n\n\n## **Virgo (August 23-September 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos sometimes forget just how easy to love they really are. And they don’t like to show any sort of vulnerability. These two notions combined mean that they typically prefer to operate under jealousy and accusations, rather than playing it cool like they so often want to do. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let yourself become consumed by the idea of love. You need to give people the chance to love you.</span>\n\n\n## **Libra (September 23-October 22)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libras are naturally independent and ambitious, which means that love is just another thing in this world that they can choose to pursue, or not pursue. This also means that when they do pick a partner, they’re nothing short of the high standards that have been set. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your high levels of self-respect often have you forcing partners to wait some time before you actually commit to anything.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found love, your focus will shift toward stability within the relationship.</span>\n\n\n## **Scorpio (October 23-November 21)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whoa, watch out, the Scorpio is coming through. Passionate, sexual, stubborn and intense, the Scorpio likes to follow the heart, rather than the brain. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is highly valued by Scorpios, and they’re used to getting their way, so their relationships often include a good bit of drama. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calm and rational partners are perfect for the Scorpio; you fit best with Pisces or Cancer.</span>\n\n\n## **Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the ultimate free-spirit, Sagittarius like to treat love like a journey, one that they’re not afraid to embark on. When it comes to matters of the heart, you enjoy throwing inhibition to the wind, jumping head-first into love.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, your intellectual nature attracts similar-minded partners, ones that share your enthusiasm for novelty experiences and seeing the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as you want, you will likely find a partner who’s just as afraid of settling down as you are.</span>\n\n\n## **Capricorn (December 22-January 19)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns like having something to work on. This is easy for them when it comes to relationships because they’re really good at seeing big-picture type of stuff. A happy, stable life with the person that they love and call their best friend is something to work toward. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re quite serious when it comes to life, so you expect your partner to be as well. Reckless, crazy passion has no place in your world.</span>\n\n\n## **Aquarius (January 20-February 18)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aquarius, your big heart often reflects the type of love you desire most: passionate, intense, hot and long-lasting. If you find yourself in love with someone, don’t be afraid to be the selfless person you are. Enjoy devoting time and energy to your relationship without playing games.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know when you’ve found the right person, because you’ll never want to let go once you do.</span>\n\n\n## **Pisces (February 19-March 20)**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pisces, one of the things you fear most is missing out on your chance to fall in love. You’re highly sensitive, which means your moods can be somewhat polarized at times. Good things in your relationship have you feeling happy, euphoric and carefree, while the bad things often ruin your entire day.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your naturally sweet and caring nature is redeeming, however, as you often put your partner’s needs before your own. Just remember not to sacrifice too much of your own life for the sake of theirs.</span>\n\n> [What Your Zodiac Sign Says About The Way You Fall In Love](http://elitedaily.com/dating/zodiac-sign-says-love/1267932/)\n\n<iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KZDVcpTTxD\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"http://elitedaily.com/dating/zodiac-sign-says-love/1267932/embed/#?secret=KZDVcpTTxD\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“What Your Zodiac Sign Says About The Way You Fall In Love” — Elite Daily\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

Not only does it release endorphins, making us feel great, but it’s been seen to affect the brain in positive and sometimes unexpected ways.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now scientists are discovering that silence is one more thing we should be seeking out for our own good. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might not come as a surprise to many of you. I can definitely believe it, as a person who cherishes his alone time and who gets easily overstimulated when there’s too much going on around me.</span>\n\n**Regenerating Brain Cells**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Published in the </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brain, Structure and Function</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> science journal, **[one 2013 study](http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/this-is-your-brain-on-silence)**used mice to analyze the effects that sound, noise and silence had on them. Looking at brain activity in the mice, researchers closely watched how different types of noise and silence affected the functioning of their brains.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silence was initially meant to be the control group in the study, but researchers quickly discovered something exciting. Exposing the mice to at least two hours of silence each day triggered the development of new cells in the hippocampus (the part of the brain linked to memory, emotion and learning).</span>\n\n**[“We saw that silence is really helping the new generated cells to differentiate into neurons, and integrate into the system](http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/this-is-your-brain-on-silence)**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” says researcher Imke Kirste.</span>\n\n**Stress Relief**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noise, on the other hand, has been seen to have a negative effect on our brains, as it increases production of stress hormones. Even when we are sleeping, the brain is able to internalize and process the noises we hear. Which means that people living in urban environments, with almost constant noise, are more at risk for chronic, **[increased levels of stress hormones](http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/this-is-your-brain-on-silence)**.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study, published in </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heart</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> journal, found that even just a couple minutes of silence can relax a person more than listening to music designed to relax you. These conclusions were based on changes in **[blood pressure and blood circulation in the brain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/).**</span>\n\n**Silence Helps Us Recharge Cognitively**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that has been researched quite thoroughly is noise pollution and how it affects cognitive task ability. In both work and school settings, noise has been seen to reduce task performance capabilities, decrease motivation to work, and increase the chance of errors while working. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The areas most affected by noise? Memory, reading attention, and problem solving. In line with this data, many studies have found that children who work in homes or classrooms that are near airplane flight routes, train tracks, and highways, exhibit lower scores in reading and develop their **[cognitive and language skills slower](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/07-08/silence.aspx).**</span>\n\nThere is some positive news on this front, however. ‘Attention restoration’ theory posits that our brains are capable of regenerating any lost cognitive capabilities by being in environments that feature low levels of sensory stimulation; or, in other words, by **[giving your brain a break](http://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_wzo/2015/08/07/150807_1710_kaplan_s._19951.pdf).**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, use this information wisely to consider the potential impact that noise may have on you or your loved ones.

                "markdown": "\nBy [**Andrea Schulman**](https://www.facebook.com/raiseyourvibrationtoday/?fref=ts) | [**Raise Your Vibration Today **](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/02/destroy-your-life-with-negativity/)\n\n*Destroy your life with negativity?* This is not a very positive title, I’ll fully admit it!\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As you may already know, I like to**[write about ways to enhance your happiness](http://www.raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/blog \"Raise Your Vibration Today Blog\")** and get in touch with your higher self. However, life is always about choice, and we can always choose to go the opposite way if we want. Sometimes we climb into the light, but other times we choose to explore the dark.</span>\n\n\n## Going to the dark side…\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Today, I’m going to switch things up. Instead of exploring how we have the ability to climb into the light, I’m going to talk about choices we make that take us in to the dark.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I speak from experience. Not only have I seen the behaviors below in some of the most miserable, unhappy people I’ve ever met, but I myself have had the experience of having a miserable life due to these behaviors.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Behaviors and choices like the ones below sent me in to a tailspin in my early twenties. I lived in a constant flux between anger, anxiety and depression. My life wasn’t all bad, but compared with today, it was a real nightmare.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In retrospect, it was all my own damn fault.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, since I’m so well-acquainted with what makes up a negative, unhappy life, I figured I’d share what I’ve learned about it with you. To be perfectly clear, I’m still human, and like most people, I still make negative choices sometimes. However, making choices to consciously let go of these behaviors regularly has made my life a LOT better.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Now as this article is inherently much more negative than my average article, I will create a positive takeaway for each item in the list. We’ll try to leave each point on a positive note. There is always, after all, a positive lesson in every dark corner, if we’re willing to look for it!</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">1. Spending more time complaining than appreciating.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You could look at *anything* from a positive perspective or a negative one. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, a pitbull could be seen as good or bad.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So could a job, or even a lost job.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So could abortion, drugs or guns for that matter.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Anything we choose to think about can be viewed from it’s potential to make life better or worse.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Choosing to complain routinely is choosing to look at people, situations and events in a negative way on a regular basis.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s choosing to view our world as ugly, hateful, wicked and intolerant.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Life doesn’t have to be bad, and the world doesn’t have to be a terrible place, but when we complain more than we appreciate, it will absolutely seem that way.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">***Positive takeaway-** Look for the good in your life every day and appreciate it like it’s your job.*</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">2. Valuing other people’s opinions over your own.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Worrying about what other people think is a one-way ticket to unhappiness. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Everyone out there is already worried about their own damn lives.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  Every person you know has a lot on his or her mind besides you.</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">They each have their own families, friends, jobs, interests, problems and health to worry about.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>They are each trying to do the best that they can from their own perspective, and they really don’t have the time or the ability to validate your experience and make you feel good about your life and how you are handling it. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Waiting for someone else’s stamp of approval is like waiting for a toddler to clean your house for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s your house, and you’re the only one in it who has the ability to get it in order the way you want it. The toddler has a whole other set of concerns and objectives that have absolutely nothing to do with keeping your world nice and tidy.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Leave it up to the toddler, and don’t be surprised when crayons get on the wall and your precious collectables end up smashed on the floor. </span>\n\n*<span class=\"s1\">**Positive takeaway-** Be your own biggest supporter and cheerleader. Even further, understand that other people need the time and space to be the same for themselves.</span>*\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">3. Settling for things you know you don’t want.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Many of us believe in a “life after death,” but ultimately, we don’t know what happens for sure when we die.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Who knows what’s coming next, or what chances you’ll have in the future?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span>\n\nAll we know is that we have this life right now, and it’s slipping through our fingers as we speak. Are you just getting by or are you embracing it?\n\nWhat do you have to lose? What are you waiting for?\n\n***Positive takeaway**-When you feel pulled to make a change, answer the call.*\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">4. Expecting higher standards for other people’s behavior than your own.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Have you ever noticed how people with road rage are often the worst drivers on the road?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">It makes sense, when you think about it. Having unrealistic expectations leaves us wide open for being angry when other people don’t meet them. When we’re angry, we’re not usually operating at our highest level.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So cut people some slack.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The driver in front of you might be sick, hurt or grieving.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Your rude neighbor might have just lost his job or separated from his wife. Your angry coworker might have been raped or tortured as a child.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You never know why people are misbehaving out there, but often it’s because they are in pain or overwhelmed by issues far greater than getting cut off in traffic, rude people or missed deadlines.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There’s no sense in being angry at everyone because they aren’t perfect. News flash- none of us are.</span>\n\n*<span class=\"s1\">**Positive takeaway-** Give other people the benefit of the doubt, they may need it a lot more than you realize.</span>*\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">5. Spewing messages of hate and intolerance.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I personally believe that words are just words, and a word like “fuck” isn’t inherently any worse than a word like “tree.” </span><span class=\"s1\">However, the way we *use* our words makes a dramatic impact on the message we’re sending out into the universe.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In other words, saying “fuck yeah” is a lot different than “go fuck yourself” or “I fucking hate my job.” </span><span class=\"s1\">The words aren’t that important, but the underlying message certainly is. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So is your underlying message ordinarily one of love or hate?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We get what we put out there in life, so when you’re regularly pumping a message of hate out into the world, don’t be surprised when you end up seriously hating your life.</span>\n\n*<span class=\"s1\">**Positive takeaway-** Remember, you reap what you sow. Let your life message be one that benefits you in the highest way possible. </span>*\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">6. Blaming other people for your own negativity.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We can complain all we want about the “negative people” in our life but when we make the choice to sit down with them and get into the drama, that negativity is just as much ours as it is their’s. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Negativity isn’t something outside of yourself that inserts itself into your experience. Negativity is something that lives inside of us, and when it’s reflected in our realities it’s because **we personally choose to experience it.**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you’re experiencing massive amounts of drama and negativity, understand that it hasn’t chosen you, you’ve chosen it. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Taking responsibility for your own negativity benefits you highly. After all, how are you supposed to create a positive life experience when you believe you are being attacked by negativity against your will?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Take control of your experience, and take responsibility for your own negativity. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">It’s ok to have a negative moment, and it’s ok to make mistakes. Just know that when you own them, you make it much easier on yourself to make more positive choices in the future.</span>\n\n*<span class=\"s1\">**Positive takeaway-** Always remember you’re in charge of your own life.</span>*\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">7. Refusing to forgive and forget.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Yes, I said forgive **and forget**. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Saying “I’ll forgive, but I’m not going to forget” is the same as saying “I’m gonna let this go, but I’m not really going to let this go.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If this is your motto when it comes to forgiveness, don’t be surprised if the anger and the pain linger on forever.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Forgive, forget and get on with your life. No one owes you any favors, explanations or apologies. It would be nice, but no one is required to do any of that and oftentimes they won’t. </span><span class=\"s1\">If you wait for other people to change before you move on with your life, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get over your anger.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Again, none of us is perfect. We all make mistakes and we can all be selfish assholes sometimes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> There are people laying in your wake of destruction too, and it’s highly unlikely they all got formal apologies. </span></span>\n\n*<span class=\"s1\">**Positive takeaway-** Choose to let go for the sake of your own sanity, and if you must modify anyone’s behavior, let it be your own.</span>*\n\n\n## One last observation…\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Writing this article has been cathartic, but it’s also been very telling about negativity!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>In focusing almost entirely on negative traits, I’ve noticed I’ve become much more accusatory and hostile in this blog post than usual.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This was completely unintentional, as the words just kind of spilled onto the page like this.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The message I take from this? Focusing on the negative makes you feel more negative. Period. Take from that what you will.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I hope you’ve enjoyed this article, despite its brutally honest approach.

Surprisingly, aside from the conventional methods of depression therapy available today, there are many more alternative techniques at one’s disposal when it comes to fighting depression.\n\nFor someone not acquainted with writing, and blog writing in particular, it may seem unusual – even outright impossible, that writing can be a mean to combat depression.\n\nFrom this reason, our aim will be to show how writing your own personal blog can help you battle, and hopefully even overcome your depression.\n\n\n## You Are No Longer Alone\n\nDepression is quite harder to handle when we are facing it alone. Here is where setting up your own blog helps you come out of your comfort zone into the wonderful world of online blogging. There are hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of people, who are blogging today and sharing their personal experiences to the public.\n\nYour blog helps you share your experiences with others so that you are no longer alone.\n\n\n## Connect With Other People by Writing A Blog\n\nMany people have, at some point, had issues with depression. Many of them also shared their experiences with others. There are many personal blogs today where people talk about their [personal experiences at combating depression](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/best-blogs-of-the-year#13).\n\nCreating your own blog gives you the opportunity to connect with people who have similar experiences and, more importantly, people who will understand and support you.\n\n\n## Express Yourself\n\nA blog is your own internet diary. You should try and treat it just like you treat a handwritten personal diary. As we’ve said earlier, unlike a handwritten personal diary, a blog lets you connect with other people, but it is the process of expressing yourself through writing that is equally important. Sometimes, we cannot handle our emotions, experiences and memories and we lack the means to express them properly.\n\nWriting is one of the best method of expressing yourself. Don’t be afraid to transfuse your thoughts into your blog.\n\n\n## Get Busy\n\nThey say idleness is a soul-killer. This is especially true for depression which cannot be successfully overcome in idleness and loneliness. If you don’t have a job, you can treat your blog as your primary occupation and devout your time to writing and improving it.\n\nGiving yourself something to be preoccupied about is a great way of deflecting harmful thoughts. Consider setting up a daily schedule for posting new blog entries. Moreover, if you have audience following and commenting your blog posts, you will have a responsibility towards them.\n\n\n## You Have a Purpose\n\nThe lack of purpose is one of the leading causes behind depression. Finding motivation can be very hard, which is especially true if you have a job that does not fulfill you. A blog gives you a chance to do something you’re good at, and something that you genuinely care about.\n\n\n## Artistic Freedom\n\nAnyone will tell you that the overwhelming feeling of freedom when writing is one of best things about being a writer.\n\nWriting a blog is no different in this regard, and you will have complete freedom at deciding what to blog about.\n\n[Art therapy](http://expandedconsciousness.com/2016/06/25/7-unusual-ways-deal-depression/) has been recognized as a proven method for combating depression. We have to emphasize that the quality of your writing is not of prime importance here. Even if it doesn’t look too good, this is not a reason to get worried or give up.\n\nYour writing is your therapy and you are doing it to get in touch with your inner being. With time and practice your writing skills will also improve.\n\n\n## Explore Your Interests\n\nWriting is far from being a mere process of typing. Composing a blog entry also involves research, planning and finally, execution. The research stage enables you to actively explore your interests, and interact with other people in the process.\n\nYou can always join the community of already established bloggers and also talk with other people regarding their experiences in writing blogs about depression.\n\n\n## Writing Can Improve Your Health\n\nAs an activity which puts your memory, creativity, emotions and intellect to work together, writing is an excellent way to improve your health. Depression can harm the balance in your organism and cause other diseases.\n\nWriting for your blog gives you a chance to externalize your negative thoughts and feelings and deal with them with more objectivity.\n\nSome studies have discovered that writing about negative experiences for 20 minutes at a time for more than three days may result in lower blood pressure and a better and more effective immune system.\n\n\n## Arouse Your Creativity\n\nThere’s no doubt that writing can sometimes be very hard work, especially for people who don’t have previous experience with writing. Of course, being depressed does not improve the situation. However, once you get past your blockade, you will find that writing, although not easy, can be very rewarding.\n\nWriting eventually lets you discover and expand your creativity and thus gives you the chance to overcome one of the most harmful symptoms of depression – lethargy.\n\n\n## Know Thyself\n\nThe Ancient Greeks knew the importance of self-knowledge and self-discovery, and the aphorism ‘know thyself’ was inscribed on the door of the famous Temple of Apollo in Delphi. It’s been said that this was what the oracle said to people who came to seek knowledge about their future.\n\n[Getting to know yourself](http://expandedconsciousness.com/2016/04/13/ancient-methods-for-curing-depression/) is a powerful prerequisite of any treatment. This is where writing can help you connect with your inner being and helps you discover things about yourself  \n you were previously unaware of.\n\n\n## Sharing With Other People\n\nSharing your thoughts, emotions and experiences with other people is arguably one of the best things about being a blogger. As we have said earlier, depression cannot be overcome without active help of other people, and the first step towards healing is when we acknowledge we have a problem.\n\nIt’s important not to keep your negative emotions and experiences all to yourself.\n\nAs soon as you gather the courage to act and talk about your problems, sooner the healing process can start.\n\n*About *author*: Samantha Brannon is an entrepreneur and freelancer.

Attraction is of course multifaceted and complex, so all of us seek out different mates. But new research has found that intelligence might be the one thing we shouldn’t be ready to settle for, as [brainy partners](http://www.simplemost.com/marrying-smart-woman-help-prolong-life/) were found to extend lifespans and keep dementia at bay.</span>\n\n[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Lawrence Whalley</span>](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3529167/Marry-intelligent-woman-defeat-dementia-men-told-Experts-say-brainy-partner-acts-buffer-disease.html)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, emeritus professor of mental health in the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the University of Aberdeen, had this to say during a talk entitled ‘Dementia: How Can We Protect Ourselves?’</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘The thing a boy is never told he needs to do if he wants to live a longer life – but what he should do – is marry an intelligent woman. There is no better buffer (to dementia) than intelligence.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study, which comes out of the [University of Aberdeen](http://www.simplemost.com/marrying-smart-woman-help-prolong-life/), studied the health of identical twins and discovered that intelligent partners were a significant factor in how well a person was protected from degenerative brain diseases (like Alzheimer’s and dementia).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was found that men who partnered with intelligent women tended to live longer, happier lives, </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had less risk of suffering from degenerative brain problems.

                "slug": "temp-slug-2600",
                "markdown": "\nThere has been a strong inflation in the number of militant atheists pompously wagging fingers at the religious. ‘Faith is clearly not true, for it’s neither rational nor empirical in nature.’ Faith consists of a Truth that cannot be justified on an objective scale from one’s own subjectivity, and therefore any belief derived from an irreproducible means is undoubtedly false to the atheist. The thing that cannot be tested is not accepted; this is an atheist’s mindset. Additionally, atheists have the rationalized brain type to nimbly forgo the abstraction and metaphor many holy texts employ. I am not a foot-peddler for religion, but the obstinate narcissists of atheism must quiet.\n\nLanguage is a means for information transfer. It is not the only way, nor is it omnipotent in its ability. Often, abstraction is needed to transfer immense concepts to others, in ways no other communicational technique can. The return of Christ is impossible, for he has died. And this is true, a physical rebirth is impossible – biology knows this. Though if the death was looked at as a degree of consciousness, this seems more public and reproducible of a substrate to maintain truth. If the second coming of Jesus were at a level of consciousness, the statement stands.\n\nCausality isn’t my God. For if He were, He’d have competition. Synchronicity exists by His side, as Jung has conjectured: A field of instantaneous connection based on meaning, which works concurrently with physical spacetime. This is the science of consciousness, i.e. the science of the next 50 years. We don’t understand consciousness; we only understand space, time, and our material reality. Yet the thing which makes it all possible [consciousness] is either faced with apathy, neglectful ignorance, or fear. We know one of the two must be true: There is a physical process causing consciousness happenings, or there is a preexisting consciousness that organizes matter. The atheist will not consider the latter. Perhaps consciousness — its direction and its degree — affects radioactive break up and electron collapse. Perhaps pushing our consciousness into an imaginary space where a future physical reality is envisaged mimics the actual experience in regard to brain activity and increases the probability that such a future will unfold. This can be looked at as a path of least resistance, while keeping intention (strength and direction) of consciousness considered. If we want to trigger an action potential in a neuron, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can work analogously to bring the neuron closer to a depolarized state, where it is facilitated in the birth of a firing signal, leading to an entire cascade of new probabilistic realities. As David Deutsche has stated:\n\n> “If you are an artist and halfway through creating a work of art you see something in it that you want to bring out, then you are being attracted by a beauty that you have not yet experienced.”\n\n The projection of consciousness to a future reality that meets an attraction within the individual will push his action there. An internal idea he passionately rips into an external state.\n\nWe again crash into this duality of internal and external world, but the rationalist only takes what he can see. Unfortunately, if to see is to understand… vision is dismal. One cannot understand the driving force and the internal calculations behind the artist’s piece; one cannot pack up his belongings and move into the artist’s mind. This is to say that one cannot mimic another’s conscious state or peer into another’s subjectivity.  \n Consciousness has eluded man for as long as we know. This is because once man is elucidated to his own consciousness, he is no longer man; he leaves the search. When a consciousness receives such a degree of resonate truth that it knows with all of its being that an answer is correct: this needs no secondary explanation, nor should it. It is at this point where the consciousness realizes the profound clarity that comes with the dismissal of a veil. A flash of insight can be used as comparison here. The high altitude burst of gamma frequency oscillation emitted when an individual gets access to such a degree of gamma state consciousness is when the highest degree of truth he has had in quite some time is elucidated. (Sheth, B. R., Sandkühler, S., & Bhattacharya, J. (2009).) *Posterior beta and anterior gamma oscillations predict cognitive insight*. So much so, it may actually be perceptible in an excited physiological state of the insula, right PFC, and anterior cingulate. A subsequent positive emotion generally follows suit too. Though one man may have a flash of insight into the nature of an external issue, another man may of *himself*. The man of internal insight has found a truth that resonates with a subjective piece of the universe; a phenomenon deafened to the atheist. Tell me how you expect such a resonance to be of any value to – never mind represented in – a different entity, with different strings. Such a resonance wouldn’t be consonant with a machine of a different assemblage. Understanding consists of a *need* to create an empathetic acceptance, a knowing of truth by an inter/intra-personal mental resonance.  \n It is natural that ignorance can cause a man to accept a false truth, which may aggregate into a foundation of ‘understanding,’ conflicting with our own. In argument this is the underlying battle, to move his truth in accordance with mine, without moving mine to his. One can also see that ego is the construct, unyielding and persistent. It is this persistence which forces a larger/more intelligent ego to compound his truth onto another’s, disregarding some of them along the way.\n\nAs John Lennox has pointed out, an atheist who stumbles upon a car engine can tell you exactly how the car engine works. The point is though, he cannot not give you an explanation of how it got there. This question is just as valid, but the atheist dismisses it. The two outlooks are as follows: It’s beyond empiricism to him and thus *unprovable*, or moreover, that the way in which the engine works *brought* it there. The rationalist asks ‘what’s going on,’ while those of faith prefer ‘who’s asking the question?’ In this competition for truth, the logic-minded look externally, while the religious look within. Thus we should not idolize logic, for it is inherently limited, and sometimes the alogical is true. Furthermore, Gödel’s theorem shows us that some truths are unprovable. Yet the limited intelligibility of the rationalist’s mind purports his foundation of logic as absolute, with every tenet axiomatic in nature.\n\nHumans are hardwired to think linearly – it’s how we measure time. So for the rationalist, the caste we’re born into has no ultimate explanation, nor does an existence proceeding death. To look before the start is illogical for a linear mind. He didn’t choose where he grew up, he didn’t choose his parents, yet he’s born and it’s game on – ‘from here forward is what I’ll ‘consider,’ he says. One who looks at time cyclically finds sense in the ideas of heaven and hell, death and rebirth. Still the problem runs deeper. It is the rationalist’s incognizant fear of the unconscious mind that impedes the self-knowledge the spiritual knows and loves. To say you understand the unconscious mind is to flatly lie. We can either muster an implicit comprehension or claim it incomprehensible altogether. Though as Jung has observed, the unconscious is the only available source of spiritual experience. It is the medium from which religious experiences seem to flow. Coincidentally, *Flow* is also the coined term for the experience by which one meshes his consciousness with the environment, where egocentric individuality dissipates altogether. In this state there is no self-critic, and the unconscious mind drives behavior as we become immersed in our favorite activities. In these states we see performance is optimal, creativity is heightened, and intuition is bountiful.\n\n**Ego**\n\nTo provide another analogy, we can look at the ego as a neuron. We have an adequate understanding of how the neuron fires mechanically but no confident way of knowing how the cascade of other summated signals – that is the unconscious – triggered that neuron with such temporal precision. As Freud explained, there is a ‘fringe of consciousness,’ with only the most salient information entering. It should be understood that it is the summation of subthreshold information – of which we are not aware – that creates the wave into conscious awareness.  \n For a moment, consider the question: What founds thought? We may consciously try to move thought in our desired direction, but what is that ruminating voice that pops into our inner dialogue throughout the day? Why are the contents sometimes even shunned by the conscious mind? This should not be the case for a consciously driven thought process. Think about a conversation or my writing this sentence. I don’t have a preexisting, consciously planned out script from which I’m typing. The content of my unconscious mind is being translated to conscious information in the form of language driven by the totality of my feeling states in what I’d like to convey. To provide a further example, think about your biggest habit. Perhaps it’s a nervous habit such as biting your nails or playing with your hair. As the frequency of these actions increase, you’ll soon realize that your hands are suddenly brought to your mouth more often. The neural pathways consistent with this activity become strengthened to such a degree that their aggregated signal is strong enough to sear this behavior into habitualization. For an undesirable habit, the behavior will continue until it crosses the individual’s fringe of consciousness, where he becomes conscious of the habit, and dismisses it. You can easily recognize yourself biting your nails, but consider ideas to work in the same way. Certainly the strength of feeling states and intentions are much more difficult to discern within our psyche. The underlying point here is that the ego is the part of our being which realizes the action and may take accountability for the action, but the belief of it driving the action is a foolish one.\n\nWe naturally identify with our conscious self, for it is the part of us we ‘see.’ However, we must understand though, that our ego is an illusory persona given to us by our brain. In neuroscience, the ego construct can be viewed as our particularly construed resting state networks (RMNs). Sub-networks within this domain include the Default Mode Network (DMN), which deals with self-reference, emotional reflection, autobiographical self-understanding, among other things. It serves as a comparative interpretation mechanism one uses to qualify one’s position in society by differentiation/dissection. Because, through evolution, a brain wired to optimize fitness was selected for, our interpretations are culturally based, and universally competitive. The pride of a currently held ideology (with which we identify) trumps the willingness to work together to get at a deeper, more unifying truth. This is because truth is relative to a group, and different groups precipitate from differentiating truths. Again, if we see that truths resonate, it is clear why groups harmonize within and clash without. Jonathan Haidt’s work on morality shows this, as we realize that truth is whatever is subjectively convincing at one’s current level of perception. At lower levels of consciousness (awareness), propositions are accepted as true, even when they are illogical. They express tenets neither intellectually provable nor practically demonstrable. Regardless, man will defend his position, however ignorant it may be.\n\nUnfortunately as a resulting happenstance, Ego becomes God to people. Even more tragically, when ego drops, one can see the cosmic comedy of that relationship. The tragedy here is that the egocentric veil rarely drops in modern society. Ironically, the one experience of transcendence – beyond an egocentric self – which sits in absolute certainty, is the experience that also sits in a medium certain to catch everybody’s prejudices. To attempt to make oneself understood is impossible without far-reaching comprehension of another’s standpoint. Perhaps a future energetic discourse that transcends language could do it, but that’s neither here nor there. The atheist, without an empathic resonance of such an experience, discounts it.\n\n> “A necessity for the eradication of the incommensurability between observer and observed is needed. A “neural language.”\n\n as W. Pauli mentions. The fear that prevents most from experiencing such transcendence is the fear of lost control. As humans, control is the thing we hold most dear to our heart. Imagining a life as a schizophrenic with no control over his actions is the worst nightmare possible for many. We take solace in the feeling of control the ego brings. Unfortunately egoic control is illusory, though one can *choose* to hold onto it. Our memories are constructed to fit a story, i.e., the memories our ego maintains to define who it thinks it is. This creates bias. Turning off memory allows highest clarity of sight. We think we are our story, and we identify with it as such. This is why the common paradigm of thought believes that the death of the ego is the death of the individual. The death one’s legacy to die must necessarily kill the man too. Anyone who has experienced an ego death – a profound spiritual experience – knows this is not the case, and the feeling of liberation from ego is ineffably beautiful.\n\nWe can look to the psychologically defined ‘insightful vs. analytic’ personal method of thinking to explain this rift between rationalists and spirituals. Insightfuls are less ‘loud’ in the mind, while considering possibilities. Analytics use ‘outsight’ where the loudest, obvious, quicker responses are reported. For a lot of day to day life, simple ‘outsight/analysis’ works. Analytics think linearly from front to back and vice versa. They also hold a tighter ‘cognitive control.’ Insightfuls think more laterally. The rationalist is the out-sighted analyst. He grips onto the self so tightly, as to surrender any other possible option. The spiritual is the insightful. Insight is derived from intuition and is the result of an understanding of the inner nature of things. With less weight on cognitive control and a more lateralized method of thought, these individuals are capable of undergoing a psychological appreciation of the fact that man is the victim of his conscious constitution more than he is the creator. To understand individuality is puppeted by a higher power still gives you a larger part in the play. But for the atheists the higher power is exclusively in ego, and stops at the State.\n\nWe can recognize prejudice and illusion only when we’re capable of taking a step back and looking back into the absolutism of our tenets, to objectively compare them with facts, while not producing an egocentric rationale as to why our conclusion is ‘still right.’ I have personally had conversations with friends where I fell victim to the same fallacy. I would notice that in discourse, one of us would realize he may be incorrect in the argument, and a subconscious transition in topic would occur, as to preserve the ego in admitting fault. This takes a great deal of awareness and mostly goes unnoticed. Donald Trump for example, is a master eluder who systematically transitions conversation once he realizes facts stack up against him, and one may say his ego is *slightly* larger than the layperson.\n\n**Unconscious Mind**\n\nI’d like to elucidate the unbeknownst benefit of egolessness with the following quote:\n\n> “Anyone who has insight into his own actions, and has thus found access to the unconscious, involuntarily exercises an influence on his environment. The deepening and broadening of consciousness produce the kind of effect which the primitives call “mana.” It is a sort of unintentional influence on the unconscious of others, a sort of unconscious prestige, and its effect lasts only so long as it is not disturbed by conscious intention.”\n\nThe quote by Jung explicates the prestige gifted upon ego absence. The Taoists call this power Wu-wei, in which De is the electromagnetic signature. In this state of being, there is no thought, as one is immersed in passion/love/oneness. Whilst in this state, the unconscious elicits a harmonious, attractive pattern, which can be perceived by others. This De signature is an ode of Truth. A sign of genuine character (unconsciously spoken), yet vibrated and perceived in the environment, often under the threshold of consciousness in another. Additionally, De *comes* from the unconscious, as do our virtues, which we consciously download as they’re considered. Taoist texts explain how “the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony, and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome.” We know this as ego, though Taoists don’t explicitly connote ego. Rather, they assert that one must just “place their will in harmony with the natural universe.” That is, to align true meaning with our actions, not to perform an action which promotes solely egoic prosperity. Wu-Wei is the method of achieving this. It is a form of “trying not to try” coined by Edward G. Slingerland. Buddhists call this state of spontaneity/nothingness ‘Sunyata.’ In Buddhist traditions “desire not to desire” is more fitting. The concept is the same, and logicians are left baffled altogether.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Westerners are starting to come to the same psychological conclusion with the phenomenon we call ‘flow,’ coined by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. In flow states, the seer and the doer merge. The observing consciousness and experiencing consciousness commune, and the driving force behind its creation is passion, for it wields “the capacity to narrow our focus so spectacularly, as to reduce the entirety of the world to the object of our desire.” Terrence McKenna alluded to the same idea in one of his talks, in which he stated:\n\n> “What I see is that the carrier of the field [of the cosmic giggle] in most people’s lives, is love. Love is some kind of output which messes with the entropic tendency toward probabilistic behavior in nature.”\n\n We see love is the most potent and harmonic awareness one can have, and it brings people the furthest. Any exceptional athlete will tell you it was his passion that drove him. Underlying it all we see that humans gain a vitality. It is vitality, that life force, which gets you furthest. And it’s derived from love. Whether it’s in the form of intellectual truth, lifelong courtship, or any form of flow in between. It’s what drives us, keeps us alive and in good health. If you lose it, you lose life. This is the idea of the soul. The Chinese call it ‘Qi,’ the Indians ‘Prana,’ the Polynesians ‘Mana,’ the Amerindians ‘Orenda,’ and the ancient Germans ‘Od.’\n\n**Synchronicity**\n\nLet’s talk about Jung and Pauli’s theory of synchronicity as an acausal connecting principle. Please make note of the distinction between synchrony, which deals with temporal coherence of events, and synchronicity, which deals specifically with external events coinciding with internal states in a way which creates a meaningful connection. Jung stated:\n\n> “Synchronicity postulates a meaning which is *a priori* in relation to human consciousness and apparently exists outside man… I am only too conscious that synchronicity is a highly abstract and ‘irrepresentable’ quantity. It ascribes to the moving body a certain psychoid [consciousness] property which, like space, time, and causality, forms a criterion of its behavior.”\n\nJung, in conjunction with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, explored the possibility that his concepts of the unconscious and synchronicity might be related to the unus mundus to which the unconscious is an expression; synchronicity, or “meaningful coincidence,” being made possible by the fact that both the observer and connected phenomenon ultimately stem from the same source, the *unus mundus*.” Any good physicist will tell you at the deepest level, everything is connected. Jung noticed we have rationality which follows causality and meaning (emotion/feeling) which appears to follow acausality, synchronistically. He noticed that synchronistic experiences (driven by meaning) seem to allow the violating of statistical laws, rather than deterministic laws. To clarify visibly, he created this chart:\n\n![Jung's Synchronicity Chart](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W8EVeiR5b9Q/U1Z1Bui_uPI/AAAAAAAACbk/ugts0lRpEq4/s1600/Sch%C3%A9ma_synchronicit%C3%A9_in_English.png)\n\n Jung also noticed that moments of synchronicity require a selfless awareness. This is what he means by ‘individuation’ in his work: to become aware of consciousness on such a level that your awareness grows to a point where ego drops. The amount of discerned awareness from our unconscious allows the unification of external with internal. McKenna, although unacquainted to Jung, empathized in this way. McKenna realized “ego is the absolute impediment to Tao,” which he mentioned in one of his last lectures. He realized if you care about what people think, i.e. try to reconstruct a synchronistic event for someone, the synchronicity won’t fall in your favor. Moments of synchronicity are entirely anecdotal, and to attempt to replay a particular experience to replicate the moment of serendipity you felt will not work. The sin here is pride, which lies in the ego. Ego doesn’t let nature manifest its intentionality. It’s like fighting a wave in the ocean: the only results are wasted energy and a less symmetric swell of water. The dimension of authenticity can’t approach you if you have this lesser concern; it augments electromagnetic vibration against resonance with the unconscious archetype. This idea is exactly consistent with the Taoist Way. “The ‘absolute knowledge’ which is characteristic of synchronistic phenomena, a knowledge not mediated by the sense organs, supports the hypotheses of a self-subsistent meaning, or even expresses its existence.” The profundity of the experiences only allude to a cosmic pun. Nature can’t overtly express itself to us — this would compromise free will, but we can observe a great sense of humor.\n\n**Cyclic Time**\n\nI have touched upon the idea of time, and in looking at synchronicity one must come to the conclusion that a form of cyclical time is necessary, as a linear time doesn’t fit the idea, and time in general is the thorn in the equation for many. Though What is time other than a rhythmic interval we use to date events, created for us by the brain’s specific functioning? The brain doesn’t perceive reality as it actually is, it only perceives what is conducive to our fitness. I can’t see anything other than visible light, because excessive stimulus is a hindrance. So it isn’t outlandish to say that time too is constrained perceptually to us. Moreover, we know that the brain calculates linearly, so our idea of time follows suit. As humans we’re looking at a few inches of string claiming that it’s straight, ignorant to the eventual loop it makes. We also see on a molecular level: one cannot tell if a reaction is moving forwards or backwards. Therefore time seems cyclical, and although potentially cyclical, I postulate the degree of awareness one has can change the timeline one is on, analogous to an electron jumping to a higher orbital state as it moves around its circular orbit. One can envision an electromagnetic correlate to consciousness and the photon-electron game it plays.\n\nRetrocausality is implicated in modern physics and coincides perfectly with the ideas of cyclic time and synchronicity. Additionally, the birth of retrocausalistic principles allows new premises which allow us to consider questions involving pre-birth and post-death. A rationalist would claim: “The ability to choose is not free, but depends on our biological inheritance,” as I have heard it stated in debate. But what bases our inheritance? As I claim, it is based from the free choices we make in this lifetime. To take karma as an example, and to look at it empirically (should we accept the ideas of the unconscious mind), the habits we create are offloaded into our unconscious mind and stay there as natural tendencies. An example is picking up trash: as I do it more it becomes ‘natural,’ and I may find myself doing it without my being aware of it. If we take the De (electromagnetic signature) of this unconscious emanation that is our built karma, we can see the potentiality veins for the future fissure as our life flows accordingly in a particular direction. So the direction I move can determine where I can/will move and where I have moved.\n\n**Brain Activity**\n\nNow let’s connect the idea of synchronicity to brain synchronization. In several studies, self-transcendent meditation has been shown to engender a change in the electromagnetic frequency of brainwave state to one of higher synchrony, that is, in-phase coherence of firing, and thus better communication between various brain parts. From this, intuition and speed of insight increase, as well as many other cognitive properties. Stanford did a study that looked at Tibetan Buddhist monks and found that thoughts were more coordinated and organized, and neuronal firing was of higher frequency. They explained “when an individual has a lot of nerve cells that fire well together, the size of the brain waves will be larger than when there are fewer nerve cells or when the nerve cells are not firing well together. The fact that the monks showed such high amplitude gamma wave activity is significant because it indicates that not only do they have a lot of healthy nerve cells, but these same nerve cells are also firing with a high degree of synchronization. Synchronizations of neural firing at high frequencies are thought to play a crucial role in integrating scattered neural processes into a highly ordered cognitive act such as memory and in inducing synaptic changes. In other words, when nerve cells are firing with a high level of synchronicity, brain cells are able to communicate with each other much more readily and the entire brain is able to function more efficiently.” *[http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/meditation-and-hd/](http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/meditation-and-hd/)*  \n We are brought back to the analogy of fighting a wave, though this time it seems it’s the ego which fights its own electromagnetic waves to prevent a more unified flow of electricity through the brain, and performance is impeded as a result. In McFadden’s 2002 study: “Synchronous firing has previously been demonstrated to correlate with awareness and perception, indicating that perturbations to the brain’s EM field also correlate with awareness. The brain’s EM field represents an integrated electromagnetic field representation of distributed neuronal information and has dynamics that closely map to those expected for a correlate of consciousness.” Again we see, as Jung mentioned, becoming aware of consciousness on such a level that ego drops is the point where unification occurs –In brain function, and in external with internal reality as a whole.\n\nHigher levels of arousal correlate with better memory retention. Attributing more energy to a stimulus designates a higher importance. The pragmatic conclusion is that attributing a higher importance to a piece of information makes it more concrete and durable on the strings which pull future behavior. The strongest neural pathways are the ones we use the most. This is known. What is also known is that passion creates a spectacular level of external attention, so as to silence the DMN (default mode network, i.e. a neuroscientific correlate to ego) and attribute all attention to a task. During attention, when allocated to a single activity, we see that firing rate is constant, but in phase coherence of firing leads to a higher frequency (gamma) oscillation, with better cognitive and behavioral activity. When you attend to a stimulus, you increase gamma synchronization and decrease alpha in superficial layers. This is true in every visual processing pathway. So from this we see that attention enhances synchronicity between brain structures, and after a point, drops ego with it. Many define ‘Genius’ by an ability to hold an extraordinary degree of attention for long periods of time to a given task. (Again, what other than love for a topic can do this?) The synchronization of firing from this egoless, spectacularly focused attention must be the key here, and we know in flow states, attention is paramount. It is an active meditation of sorts, where attention is optimal and learning occurs most quickly and strongly. Geniuses alike are humble people. This is because they’ll tell you they didn’t think of their most brilliant ideas or consciously perform their most brilliant actions. The ideas/actions simply came to them, as if injected from a universal bank into their awareness. Vindicating this further, recently in 2016, San Francisco State University performed a study which found that complex ideas can enter consciousness automatically.\n\nSelen Atasoy wrote a paper called “Consciousness with Connectome-specific Harmonic Waves,” where “We found that structured oscillatory patterns naturally self-organize on the human connectome for a wide-range of diffusion parameters in the model. …we observed a decrease in the frequency of coherent oscillations when excitatory activity is decreased, modelled by slower diffusion of excitation, or when inhibitory activity is increased, modelled by faster diffusion of inhibition in the neural field model.” Again, here we see less excitability, which can be looked at as attention in this context, decreases frequency of oscillation, moving us away from gamma consciousness. We can imagine it is the inhibition – our agency of ‘free-wont’ or egoic neglect – which can do this.  \n Hans-Peter Dürr, head of Germany’s Max Planck Institute of Physics, suggested it is the electromagnetic radiation surrounding electrons in a bio molecules that gives a living organism its coherence. Dürr’s suggestion may not be far off the mark, as Yale neuroscientist David A. McCormick collaborated with Haider and Fröhlich to come to a similar conclusion. They found “Whether or not these field potentials may also influence local neuronal network activity is still unknown, although the close apposition of pyramidal cell apical dendrites may provide one avenue for synchronization through local fields” Thus, neocortical neuronal networks may not only be defined by their anatomical interconnectivity and the status of the synaptic activity that binds them together but also by the spatially and temporally complex EFs in which they are embedded.” (Haider & McCormick, 2009), (Fröhlich & McCormick, 2010). These scientists found a feedback between brain activity and the endogenous electric field the brain creates. So unavoidably we crash into the possibility that even the thoughts and brain activity we experience are founded, at least in part, by the frequency of oscillation we are emanating. Therefore, coherent thoughts, including the ones of brilliance, are a potential byproduct of synchronistic electromagnetic movement of our brain’s endogenous electromagnetic field. And as we’ve seen, the ego is absolutely deleterious to an optimal natural rhythm.\n\nLastly, I’d like to bring attention to a 2014 study by Flavio Frohlich’s team, which found that weak, exogenously applied electric fields only significantly augmented our endogenous electric field when frequency of stimulation was consonant or at a harmonic of the endogenous frequency. In this way it seems that the information we store as truth exists at a particular frequency which is perceptible in others who share it, from an excitation/strengthening of one’s own knowing by the other. Recall back to the introduction, where empathy was looked at as a knowing of truth by an interpersonal mental resonance. Now from the Ego section, where Jonathan Haidt pointed out groups precipitate from differentiating truths. The mutual truths (i.e. intra-group resonance derived from a common subjective tenet) effectively bind these people together. And as we know, for some of the deepest truths, e.g. existential truth, a desire for vindication via resonance in others is critical.\n\n> “For the weaker resonances, it can be argued that the widespread possession of a resonance of whatever strength aids neurons in the integration of their inputs. In effect, the establishment of even a weak resonance makes a neuron a good listener for activity within a specialized frequency band. A host of good listeners, mutually connected, should tune networks to operate in frequency ranges of special biological meaning.”\n\n Hutcheon, B., & Yarom, Y. (2000). *Resonance, oscillation and the intrinsic frequency preferences of neurons*. Here we see Hutcheon and Yarom posit that the specific frequency of a resonance attunes other brain parts to allow a connection to be made, specific to a biological state. The ego can be seen as the out-of-tune trumpet disorganizing an orchestra’s symphony. Its silencing allows for a deeper listening, and a wider breadth of brain functioning. The ego’s interruption – for its own prerogative – will never listen intently to the tune of possibility, for its mere presence precludes the experience.\n\nOur brain’s default mode network was found to be activated when our core values are considered. As we know, our biases refract awareness, rather than reflect it. We naturally, usually unconsciously, superimpose conception to our experience, augmenting it. Stephen LaBerge uses experience of highest ‘potential’ synonymously with least egoic skew. Even intuitively, we see others are getting at this same idea, and have been for thousands of years, as seen in the early concepts of Wu-Wei and Sunyata, and the more recent concept of Flow.\n\n**Thought as an interconnected process of EM feedback**\n\nEven thought is controlled by a higher principle. As we now understand in the feedback of electromagnetic oscillation on brain activity, we can extrapolate this same idea to any interaction. In dialogue between two people, there exists two biochemical oscillators throwing waves at one another. The endogenous waves are undoubtedly augmented by the oncoming ones, and this is true for both parties. What changes, though, is the information embedded in these volleys, which determines directionality of conversation. This can be viewed as a constellation of thoughts and emotions which manifests itself in consciousness as an attitude which elicits a certain energy field.\n\nI postulate that we can empirically observe synchronization as it occurs in dialogue when a mutual truth is perceived by both parties, and a subsequent resonance-induced spike in an EEG signal results from this acknowledgement of understanding. Understanding creates a form of ecstasy, and this profound joy can vindicate the understanding. Einstein said conceiving the theory of relativity was the happiest thought of his life. Though his resonance of subjective truth rang much deeper into the cosmic sink of information, far beyond a transfer between two people. Any flash of insight works in this way. Yuri Lazebnik studies communication and came to the same realization, though by different means. He studied the state of brain coupling, or “cumulative flow” between two people when they clicked, and could even finish the other’s words as their brain patterning was mimicked. He therefore realized that the individualistic talking vs. listening isn’t as true as it may seem. “Communication is a singular act encompassing two brains.” [http://nptel.ac.in/pdf/demyst_combined_dec2012.pdf](http://nptel.ac.in/pdf/demyst_combined_dec2012.pdf)  \n Mimicked patterning occurs in every encounter. Riveted audiences who are listening to a curator are actually mimicking the brain activity of the speaker via their mirror neurons. We become entranced in a single signal. One may even consider intelligence as the ability to effectively curate a collective consciousness, to sway the most energy to your specific state, e.g. truth. This is the act of eliciting an electromagnetic conscious field so powerful that it trumps the fields that oppose it and subsequently collapses more fields into it. (A phenomenon seen in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imagining). Remember, if there is a feedback loop of EM on brain activity, those who agree with a speaker, athlete, etc. are mimicking his activity in their own mental state and perhaps subsequently increasing the vigor of the performer’s own act. When an audience is repulsed by a phenomenon, you’ll find performance of the act is lackluster. Similarity facilities cohesion. And passion is one of the strongest conscious forces. Magical things emerge from grouping people together who all share a common passion. (Festivals, political rallies, etc.). So perhaps a cumulative willingness to see a good show will enable a good show to come. As David R Hawkins stated,\n\n> “Great attractors create context. The motives which arise from one’s principles to which one is committed, determines one’s capacity to understand and attribute significance.”\n\n Having such a visceral passion increases the ability to entrance an audience. This can be considered speaking from the soul, as the Taoists have noted, where others can’t help but taste the righteousness of the actions performed. Doing so, as the greats do, compel a consent of its viewers, as to submit the viewers’ field pattern into a synchronization that mimics this specific style of processing, decision making, and virtuosity of the performer.\n\n**Symmetry**\n\nThe laws of the universe are symmetrical – physicists have shown us this. Empathy and reciprocity are also symmetrical. Symmetrical interactions send the moral message “we are all the same,” while asymmetrical interactions may send the message “I am special; better than you.” This is at an interpersonal level, as too is the inherent attractiveness of symmetry in faces. On a chemical level, pharmaceutical companies strive to create molecules minimizing unwanted side effects. It is important to highlight the relationship between molecular geometry and bioactivity. The concept of “chiral toxicology” is explored by chemists, who look at the diverse impact of chirality on multiple aspects of toxicology. To do this, appropriate chiral antidotes must be selected for therapeutic benefit and to minimize adverse events. This isn’t so much about the symmetry of the molecule, as most of biomolecules are chiral, but about the chemicals having the proper chiral configuration to coalesce with its receptor site. “Chirally correct” is the term required for a good drug, i.e. one that mimics the lock and key manner of natural products. In pharmaceuticals, we typically see only one enantiomer of a racemic drug as effective and therapeutic. The second enantiomer does not have the desired therapeutic affect and may actually have an adverse toxic effect. For this reason, optical purity is critical.\n\nConsciousness is the same way. Manly P. Hall stated, “experiences are the chemicals with which the philosopher experiments.” No matter how much you learn, the only way to integrate all of what you are experiencing in your evolution of consciousness is to experience it in your three-dimensional reality.  \n From synchronization of brain activity, we can understand a symmetric and integrative consciousness to parallel the chemical proclivities of nature. We see nature favors a balanced paradigm, with no residual refuse. This is likely because nature favors the least energy expenditure in creation. The earth is round to minimize gravitational pull, bubbles are round to minimize surface tension energy. An enantiomer that doesn’t bind to a receptor is also wasteful, and the bodily consequence is typically harmful. The act of a molecule reaching and fitting its target receptor site can be looked at several levels of abstraction higher in an individual finding his passion. The energy goes into good use by a natural, instinctual predisposition of nature. The spontaneity of action while engaged in a passion-filled activity is similar to the fluidity of our natural biochemical processes. Forcing a behavior or a synthetic molecule into a receptor site never works quite as well and insinuates that holding a high moral standard creates a reciprocation from the universe.\n\nWe can surmise that minimizing energy in thought should be favored, which likely has a strong negative correlation with our egocentric self-critic. Any enlightened guru will tell you, when thought stops, you’re close. We need to use our own subjective truth to get closest to a perfect symmetry, to a level of enlightenment where the physical has realized its nature. Such a form of existence can only be transcendental, since, as the knowledge of future or spatially distant events shows, it is contained in a psychically relative space and time, that is to say in an irrepresentable space-time continuum. The axiom of relativity inhibits those with an ego from reaching this transcendental state. The ego neglects truth to protect a preexisting ideal it has grouped itself into. As consciousness progresses from an atom to a human, the only thing that evolves is the capacity to know, and the wisest members of society know their truth, or lack thereof.\n\nNegative emotion (ex: anger, frustration) bring us further from absolute symmetry, as it’s associated with erratic, incoherent patterns, as seen in heart rhythm. Beating patterns change as emotions do, and the endocrine system secretes hormones directly into blood accordingly, which soon enter the central nervous system. Cortisol, for example, is a hormone released during stress, which shortens telomere length and expedites the aging process. Pent up anger, frustration, and jealousy are conducive to cortisol release. The inverse in hearth rhythm is true for positive emotions, and both can be measured via spectral analysis. Sine wave-like pattern are organized, and linked with reduction in mental dialogue, less stress, emotional balance, enhanced clarity, intuition, and cognition.  \n A study recently showed attractiveness and dance ability to be positively correlated. A rationalist would dismiss a confounding variable such as the confidence which comes with attractiveness to entirely create this finding, without understanding why such a rationale is arbitrary. Confidence can be seen as attractive because it means one has a high synchronization of neuron firing. Many ‘go’ signals from different areas leads to lesser inhibition and more fluid neuronal flow. On the deepest level, synchrony is attractive. If we are patterns of information, it’s quantified, and the greatly patterned are genetically attractive. (Born into a quantity). Even phenotype is a pattern of DNA expression, with symmetrical pattern being selected for. Neural firing and phenotypic make up are one in the same: a higher capacity for harmony.\n\nBeauty is aligning external truth with internal truth. An instrumental purpose of beauty is attraction. A beautiful object is beautiful to people who appreciate the beauty. (Genetically agree/resonate, like pheromones do). Though as David Deutsche has pointed out, the beauty isn’t in the content of the information, it’s in the form. (E.g. music *represents* an emotion). It is not the sound of language, but the meaning behind the representation we have for the symbols verbalized, that resonate as truthful. We share feeling states through the similar association of symbols. Inescapably we see something innate within us that longs for cohesion. We want to be understood and we want to understand. As we can see in morality, confidence, facial symmetry, and chemical structure, a cosmic equation whispers ‘good’ in some sense. These qualities even create more harmonious brain waves in those who consent to them. They move the meta-pattern of information we are closer to complete synchronicity. Life doesn’t just give us sound. It gives us the opportunity to turn our sound into a symphony. Unfortunately excessive pride, stubbornness, jealously, blame, hostility, intolerance, denial, resentment, and separation aren’t conducive to a corroboration of truth. And as poet John Keats has said *“Beauty is truth, truth beauty.”  \n*\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",
                "html": "<p>There has been a strong inflation in the number of militant atheists pompously wagging fingers at the religious. ‘Faith is clearly not true, for it’s neither rational nor empirical in nature.’ Faith consists of a Truth that cannot be justified on an objective scale from one’s own subjectivity, and therefore any belief derived from an irreproducible means is undoubtedly false to the atheist. The thing that cannot be tested is not accepted; this is an atheist’s mindset. Additionally, atheists have the rationalized brain type to nimbly forgo the abstraction and metaphor many holy texts employ. I am not a foot-peddler for religion, but the obstinate narcissists of atheism must quiet. </p>\n<p>Language is a means for information transfer. It is not the only way, nor is it omnipotent in its ability. Often, abstraction is needed to transfer immense concepts to others, in ways no other communicational technique can. The return of Christ is impossible, for he has died. And this is true, a physical rebirth is impossible – biology knows this. Though if the death was looked at as a degree of consciousness, this seems more public and reproducible of a substrate to maintain truth. If the second coming of Jesus were at a level of consciousness, the statement stands. </p>\n<p>Causality isn’t my God. For if He were, He’d have competition. Synchronicity exists by His side, as Jung has conjectured: A field of instantaneous connection based on meaning, which works concurrently with physical spacetime. This is the science of consciousness, i.e. the science of the next 50 years. We don’t understand consciousness; we only understand space, time, and our material reality. Yet the thing which makes it all possible [consciousness] is either faced with apathy, neglectful ignorance, or fear. We know one of the two must be true: There is a physical process causing consciousness happenings, or there is a preexisting consciousness that organizes matter. The atheist will not consider the latter. Perhaps consciousness &#8212; its direction and its degree &#8212; affects radioactive break up and electron collapse. Perhaps pushing our consciousness into an imaginary space where a future physical reality is envisaged mimics the actual experience in regard to brain activity and increases the probability that such a future will unfold. This can be looked at as a path of least resistance, while keeping intention (strength and direction) of consciousness considered. If we want to trigger an action potential in a neuron, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can work analogously to bring the neuron closer to a depolarized state, where it is facilitated in the birth of a firing signal, leading to an entire cascade of new probabilistic realities.  As David Deutsche has stated: </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you are an artist and halfway through creating a work of art you see something in it that you want to bring out, then you are being attracted by a beauty that you have not yet experienced.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> The projection of consciousness to a future reality that meets an attraction within the individual will push his action there. An internal idea he passionately rips into an external state. </p>\n<p>We again crash into this duality of internal and external world, but the rationalist only takes what he can see. Unfortunately, if to see is to understand… vision is dismal. One cannot understand the driving force and the internal calculations behind the artist’s piece; one cannot pack up his belongings and move into the artist’s mind. This is to say that one cannot mimic another’s conscious state or peer into another’s subjectivity.<br />\nConsciousness has eluded man for as long as we know. This is because once man is elucidated to his own consciousness, he is no longer man; he leaves the search. When a consciousness receives such a degree of resonate truth that it knows with all of its being that an answer is correct: this needs no secondary explanation, nor should it. It is at this point where the consciousness realizes the profound clarity that comes with the dismissal of a veil. A flash of insight can be used as comparison here. The high altitude burst of gamma frequency oscillation emitted when an individual gets access to such a degree of gamma state consciousness is when the highest degree of truth he has had in quite some time is elucidated. (Sheth, B. R., Sandkühler, S., &amp; Bhattacharya, J. (2009).) <em>Posterior beta and anterior gamma oscillations predict cognitive insight</em>. So much so, it may actually be perceptible in an excited physiological state of the insula, right PFC, and anterior cingulate. A subsequent positive emotion generally follows suit too. Though one man may have a flash of insight into the nature of an external issue, another man may of <em>himself</em>. The man of internal insight has found a truth that resonates with a subjective piece of the universe; a phenomenon deafened to the atheist. Tell me how you expect such a resonance to be of any value to &#8211; never mind represented in &#8211; a different entity, with different strings. Such a resonance wouldn’t be consonant with a machine of a different assemblage. Understanding consists of a <em>need</em> to create an empathetic acceptance, a knowing of truth by an inter/intra-personal mental resonance.<br />\nIt is natural that ignorance can cause a man to accept a false truth, which may aggregate into a foundation of ‘understanding,’ conflicting with our own. In argument this is the underlying battle, to move his truth in accordance with mine, without moving mine to his. One can also see that ego is the construct, unyielding and persistent. It is this persistence which forces a larger/more intelligent ego to compound his truth onto another’s, disregarding some of them along the way.</p>\n<p>As John Lennox has pointed out, an atheist who stumbles upon a car engine can tell you exactly how the car engine works. The point is though, he cannot not give you an explanation of how it got there. This question is just as valid, but the atheist dismisses it. The two outlooks are as follows: It’s beyond empiricism to him and thus <em>unprovable</em>, or moreover, that the way in which the engine works <em>brought</em> it there. The rationalist asks ‘what’s going on,’ while those of faith prefer ‘who’s asking the question?’ In this competition for truth, the logic-minded look externally, while the religious look within. Thus we should not idolize logic, for it is inherently limited, and sometimes the alogical is true. Furthermore, Gödel’s theorem shows us that some truths are unprovable. Yet the limited intelligibility of the rationalist’s mind purports his foundation of logic as absolute, with every tenet axiomatic in nature. </p>\n<p>Humans are hardwired to think linearly – it’s how we measure time. So for the rationalist, the caste we’re born into has no ultimate explanation, nor does an existence proceeding death. To look before the start is illogical for a linear mind. He didn’t choose where he grew up, he didn’t choose his parents, yet he’s born and it’s game on – ‘from here forward is what I’ll ‘consider,’ he says. One who looks at time cyclically finds sense in the ideas of heaven and hell, death and rebirth. Still the problem runs deeper. It is the rationalist’s incognizant fear of the unconscious mind that impedes the self-knowledge the spiritual knows and loves. To say you understand the unconscious mind is to flatly lie. We can either muster an implicit comprehension or claim it incomprehensible altogether. Though as Jung has observed, the unconscious is the only available source of spiritual experience. It is the medium from which religious experiences seem to flow. Coincidentally, <em>Flow</em> is also the coined term for the experience by which one meshes his consciousness with the environment, where egocentric individuality dissipates altogether. In this state there is no self-critic, and the unconscious mind drives behavior as we become immersed in our favorite activities. In these states we see performance is optimal, creativity is heightened, and intuition is bountiful. </p>\n<p><strong>Ego</strong></p>\n<p>To provide another analogy, we can look at the ego as a neuron. We have an adequate understanding of how the neuron fires mechanically but no confident way of knowing how the cascade of other summated signals &#8211; that is the unconscious – triggered that neuron with such temporal precision. As Freud explained, there is a ‘fringe of consciousness,’ with only the most salient information entering. It should be understood that it is the summation of subthreshold information – of which we are not aware &#8211; that creates the wave into conscious awareness.<br />\nFor a moment, consider the question: What founds thought? We may consciously try to move thought in our desired direction, but what is that ruminating voice that pops into our inner dialogue throughout the day? Why are the contents sometimes even shunned by the conscious mind? This should not be the case for a consciously driven thought process. Think about a conversation or my writing this sentence. I don&#8217;t have a preexisting, consciously planned out script from which I&#8217;m typing. The content of my unconscious mind is being translated to conscious information in the form of language driven by the totality of my feeling states in what I&#8217;d like to convey. To provide a further example, think about your biggest habit. Perhaps it’s a nervous habit such as biting your nails or playing with your hair. As the frequency of these actions increase, you’ll soon realize that your hands are suddenly brought to your mouth more often. The neural pathways consistent with this activity become strengthened to such a degree that their aggregated signal is strong enough to sear this behavior into habitualization. For an undesirable habit, the behavior will continue until it crosses the individual’s fringe of consciousness, where he becomes conscious of the habit, and dismisses it. You can easily recognize yourself biting your nails, but consider ideas to work in the same way. Certainly the strength of feeling states and intentions are much more difficult to discern within our psyche. The underlying point here is that the ego is the part of our being which realizes the action and may take accountability for the action, but the belief of it driving the action is a foolish one.</p>\n<p>We naturally identify with our conscious self, for it is the part of us we ‘see.’ However, we must understand though, that our ego is an illusory persona given to us by our brain. In neuroscience, the ego construct can be viewed as our particularly construed resting state networks (RMNs). Sub-networks within this domain include the Default Mode Network (DMN), which deals with self-reference, emotional reflection, autobiographical self-understanding, among other things. It serves as a comparative interpretation mechanism one uses to qualify one’s position in society by differentiation/dissection. Because, through evolution, a brain wired to optimize fitness was selected for, our interpretations are culturally based, and universally competitive. The pride of a currently held ideology (with which we identify) trumps the willingness to work together to get at a deeper, more unifying truth. This is because truth is relative to a group, and different groups precipitate from differentiating truths. Again, if we see that truths resonate, it is clear why groups harmonize within and clash without. Jonathan Haidt’s work on morality shows this, as we realize that truth is whatever is subjectively convincing at one&#8217;s current level of perception. At lower levels of consciousness (awareness), propositions are accepted as true, even when they are illogical. They express tenets neither intellectually provable nor practically demonstrable. Regardless, man will defend his position, however ignorant it may be.  </p>\n<p>Unfortunately as a resulting happenstance, Ego becomes God to people. Even more tragically, when ego drops, one can see the cosmic comedy of that relationship. The tragedy here is that the egocentric veil rarely drops in modern society. Ironically, the one experience of transcendence &#8211; beyond an egocentric self &#8211; which sits in absolute certainty, is the experience that also sits in a medium certain to catch everybody’s prejudices. To attempt to make oneself understood is impossible without far-reaching comprehension of another’s standpoint. Perhaps a future energetic discourse that transcends language could do it, but that’s neither here nor there. The atheist, without an empathic resonance of such an experience, discounts it. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“A necessity for the eradication of the incommensurability between observer and observed is needed. A &#8220;neural language.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> as W. Pauli mentions. The fear that prevents most from experiencing such transcendence is the fear of lost control. As humans, control is the thing we hold most dear to our heart. Imagining a life as a schizophrenic with no control over his actions is the worst nightmare possible for many. We take solace in the feeling of control the ego brings. Unfortunately egoic control is illusory, though one can <em>choose</em> to hold onto it. Our memories are constructed to fit a story, i.e., the memories our ego maintains to define who it thinks it is. This creates bias. Turning off memory allows highest clarity of sight. We think we are our story, and we identify with it as such. This is why the common paradigm of thought believes that the death of the ego is the death of the individual. The death one’s legacy to die must necessarily kill the man too. Anyone who has experienced an ego death – a profound spiritual experience &#8211; knows this is not the case, and the feeling of liberation from ego is ineffably beautiful.</p>\n<p>We can look to the psychologically defined ‘insightful vs. analytic’ personal method of thinking to explain this rift between rationalists and spirituals. Insightfuls are less &#8216;loud&#8217; in the mind, while considering possibilities. Analytics use &#8216;outsight&#8217; where the loudest, obvious, quicker responses are reported. For a lot of day to day life, simple &#8216;outsight/analysis&#8217; works. Analytics think linearly from front to back and vice versa. They also hold a tighter &#8216;cognitive control.’ Insightfuls think more laterally. The rationalist is the out-sighted analyst. He grips onto the self so tightly, as to surrender any other possible option. The spiritual is the insightful. Insight is derived from intuition and is the result of an understanding of the inner nature of things. With less weight on cognitive control and a more lateralized method of thought, these individuals are capable of undergoing a psychological appreciation of the fact that man is the victim of his conscious constitution more than he is the creator. To understand individuality is puppeted by a higher power still gives you a larger part in the play. But for the atheists the higher power is exclusively in ego, and stops at the State. </p>\n<p>We can recognize prejudice and illusion only when we’re capable of taking a step back and looking back into the absolutism of our tenets, to objectively compare them with facts, while not producing an egocentric rationale as to why our conclusion is ‘still right.’ I have personally had conversations with friends where I fell victim to the same fallacy. I would notice that in discourse, one of us would realize he may be incorrect in the argument, and a subconscious transition in topic would occur, as to preserve the ego in admitting fault. This takes a great deal of awareness and mostly goes unnoticed. Donald Trump for example, is a master eluder who systematically transitions conversation once he realizes facts stack up against him, and one may say his ego is <em>slightly</em> larger than the layperson.  </p>\n<p><strong>Unconscious Mind</strong></p>\n<p>I’d like to elucidate the unbeknownst benefit of egolessness with the following quote: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Anyone who has insight into his own actions, and has thus found access to the unconscious, involuntarily exercises an influence on his environment. The deepening and broadening of consciousness produce the kind of effect which the primitives call “mana.” It is a sort of unintentional influence on the unconscious of others, a sort of unconscious prestige, and its effect lasts only so long as it is not disturbed by conscious intention.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The quote by Jung explicates the prestige gifted upon ego absence. The Taoists call this power Wu-wei, in which De is the electromagnetic signature. In this state of being, there is no thought, as one is immersed in passion/love/oneness. Whilst in this state, the unconscious elicits a harmonious, attractive pattern, which can be perceived by others. This De signature is an ode of Truth. A sign of genuine character (unconsciously spoken), yet vibrated and perceived in the environment, often under the threshold of consciousness in another. Additionally, De <em>comes</em> from the unconscious, as do our virtues, which we consciously download as they’re considered. Taoist texts explain how “the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony, and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome.” We know this as ego, though Taoists don’t explicitly connote ego. Rather, they assert that one must just “place their will in harmony with the natural universe.” That is, to align true meaning with our actions, not to perform an action which promotes solely egoic prosperity. Wu-Wei is the method of achieving this. It is a form of “trying not to try” coined by Edward G. Slingerland. Buddhists call this state of spontaneity/nothingness &#8216;Sunyata.’ In Buddhist traditions “desire not to desire” is more fitting. The concept is the same, and logicians are left baffled altogether.  </p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Westerners are starting to come to the same psychological conclusion with the phenomenon we call &#8216;flow,’ coined by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. In flow states, the seer and the doer merge. The observing consciousness and experiencing consciousness commune, and the driving force behind its creation is passion, for it wields “the capacity to narrow our focus so spectacularly, as to reduce the entirety of the world to the object of our desire.” Terrence McKenna alluded to the same idea in one of his talks, in which he stated:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;What I see is that the carrier of the field [of the cosmic giggle] in most people&#8217;s lives, is love. Love is some kind of output which messes with the entropic tendency toward probabilistic behavior in nature.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p> We see love is the most potent and harmonic awareness one can have, and it brings people the furthest. Any exceptional athlete will tell you it was his passion that drove him. Underlying it all we see that humans gain a vitality. It is vitality, that life force, which gets you furthest. And it&#8217;s derived from love. Whether it&#8217;s in the form of intellectual truth, lifelong courtship, or any form of flow in between. It&#8217;s what drives us, keeps us alive and in good health. If you lose it, you lose life. This is the idea of the soul. The Chinese call it &#8216;Qi,’ the Indians ‘Prana,’ the Polynesians ‘Mana,’ the Amerindians ‘Orenda,’ and the ancient Germans ‘Od.’</p>\n<p><strong>Synchronicity</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s talk about Jung and Pauli’s theory of synchronicity as an acausal connecting principle. Please make note of the distinction between synchrony, which deals with temporal coherence of events, and synchronicity, which deals specifically with external events coinciding with internal states in a way which creates a meaningful connection. Jung stated: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Synchronicity postulates a meaning which is <em>a priori</em> in relation to human consciousness and apparently exists outside man… I am only too conscious that synchronicity is a highly abstract and ‘irrepresentable’ quantity. It ascribes to the moving body a certain psychoid [consciousness] property which, like space, time, and causality, forms a criterion of its behavior.” </p></blockquote>\n<p>Jung, in conjunction with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, explored the possibility that his concepts of the unconscious and synchronicity might be related to the unus mundus to which the unconscious is an expression; synchronicity, or &#8220;meaningful coincidence,” being made possible by the fact that both the observer and connected phenomenon ultimately stem from the same source, the <em>unus mundus</em>.&#8221; Any good physicist will tell you at the deepest level, everything is connected.  Jung noticed we have rationality which follows causality and meaning (emotion/feeling) which appears to follow acausality, synchronistically. He noticed that synchronistic experiences (driven by meaning) seem to allow the violating of statistical laws, rather than deterministic laws. To clarify visibly, he created this chart:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W8EVeiR5b9Q/U1Z1Bui_uPI/AAAAAAAACbk/ugts0lRpEq4/s1600/Sch%C3%A9ma_synchronicit%C3%A9_in_English.png\" alt=\"Jung's Synchronicity Chart\" /></p>\n<p> Jung also noticed that moments of synchronicity require a selfless awareness. This is what he means by ‘individuation’ in his work: to become aware of consciousness on such a level that your awareness grows to a point where ego drops. The amount of discerned awareness from our unconscious allows the unification of external with internal. McKenna, although unacquainted to Jung, empathized in this way. McKenna realized “ego is the absolute impediment to Tao,” which he mentioned in one of his last lectures. He realized if you care about what people think, i.e. try to reconstruct a synchronistic event for someone, the synchronicity won’t fall in your favor. Moments of synchronicity are entirely anecdotal, and to attempt to replay a particular experience to replicate the moment of serendipity you felt will not work. The sin here is pride, which lies in the ego. Ego doesn’t let nature manifest its intentionality. It’s like fighting a wave in the ocean: the only results are wasted energy and a less symmetric swell of water. The dimension of authenticity can’t approach you if you have this lesser concern; it augments electromagnetic vibration against resonance with the unconscious archetype. This idea is exactly consistent with the Taoist Way. “The ‘absolute knowledge’ which is characteristic of synchronistic phenomena, a knowledge not mediated by the sense organs, supports the hypotheses of a self-subsistent meaning, or even expresses its existence.” The profundity of the experiences only allude to a cosmic pun. Nature can’t overtly express itself to us &#8212; this would compromise free will, but we can observe a great sense of humor.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyclic Time</strong></p>\n<p>I have touched upon the idea of time, and in looking at synchronicity one must come to the conclusion that a form of cyclical time is necessary, as a linear time doesn’t fit the idea, and time in general is the thorn in the equation for many. Though What is time other than a rhythmic interval we use to date events, created for us by the brain’s specific functioning? The brain doesn’t perceive reality as it actually is, it only perceives what is conducive to our fitness. I can’t see anything other than visible light, because excessive stimulus is a hindrance. So it isn’t outlandish to say that time too is constrained perceptually to us. Moreover, we know that the brain calculates linearly, so our idea of time follows suit. As humans we’re looking at a few inches of string claiming that it’s straight, ignorant to the eventual loop it makes. We also see on a molecular level: one cannot tell if a reaction is moving forwards or backwards. Therefore time seems cyclical, and although potentially cyclical, I postulate the degree of awareness one has can change the timeline one is on, analogous to an electron jumping to a higher orbital state as it moves around its circular orbit. One can envision an electromagnetic correlate to consciousness and the photon-electron game it plays. </p>\n<p>Retrocausality is implicated in modern physics and coincides perfectly with the ideas of cyclic time and synchronicity. Additionally, the birth of retrocausalistic principles allows new premises which allow us to consider questions involving pre-birth and post-death. A rationalist would claim: &#8220;The ability to choose is not free, but depends on our biological inheritance,” as I have heard it stated in debate. But what bases our inheritance? As I claim, it is based from the free choices we make in this lifetime. To take karma as an example, and to look at it empirically (should we accept the ideas of the unconscious mind), the habits we create are offloaded into our unconscious mind and stay there as natural tendencies. An example is picking up trash: as I do it more it becomes ‘natural,’ and I may find myself doing it without my being aware of it. If we take the De (electromagnetic signature) of this unconscious emanation that is our built karma, we can see the potentiality veins for the future fissure as our life flows accordingly in a particular direction. So the direction I move can determine where I can/will move and where I have moved.  </p>\n<p><strong>Brain Activity</strong></p>\n<p>Now let’s connect the idea of synchronicity to brain synchronization. In several studies, self-transcendent meditation has been shown to engender a change in the electromagnetic frequency of brainwave state to one of higher synchrony, that is, in-phase coherence of firing, and thus better communication between various brain parts. From this, intuition and speed of insight increase, as well as many other cognitive properties. Stanford did a study that looked at Tibetan Buddhist monks and found that thoughts were more coordinated and organized, and neuronal firing was of higher frequency. They explained &#8220;when an individual has a lot of nerve cells that fire well together, the size of the brain waves will be larger than when there are fewer nerve cells or when the nerve cells are not firing well together. The fact that the monks showed such high amplitude gamma wave activity is significant because it indicates that not only do they have a lot of healthy nerve cells, but these same nerve cells are also firing with a high degree of synchronization. Synchronizations of neural firing at high frequencies are thought to play a crucial role in integrating scattered neural processes into a highly ordered cognitive act such as memory and in inducing synaptic changes. In other words, when nerve cells are firing with a high level of synchronicity, brain cells are able to communicate with each other much more readily and the entire brain is able to function more efficiently.&#8221; <em><a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/meditation-and-hd/\">http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/meditation-and-hd/</a></em><br />\nWe are brought back to the analogy of fighting a wave, though this time it seems it’s the ego which fights its own electromagnetic waves to prevent a more unified flow of electricity through the brain, and performance is impeded as a result. In McFadden&#8217;s 2002 study: &#8220;Synchronous firing has previously been demonstrated to correlate with awareness and perception, indicating that perturbations to the brain&#8217;s EM field also correlate with awareness. The brain&#8217;s EM field represents an integrated electromagnetic field representation of distributed neuronal information and has dynamics that closely map to those expected for a correlate of consciousness.” Again we see, as Jung mentioned, becoming aware of consciousness on such a level that ego drops is the point where unification occurs &#8211;In brain function, and in external with internal reality as a whole.</p>\n<p>Higher levels of arousal correlate with better memory retention. Attributing more energy to a stimulus designates a higher importance. The pragmatic conclusion is that attributing a higher importance to a piece of information makes it more concrete and durable on the strings which pull future behavior. The strongest neural pathways are the ones we use the most. This is known. What is also known is that passion creates a spectacular level of external attention, so as to silence the DMN (default mode network, i.e. a neuroscientific correlate to ego) and attribute all attention to a task. During attention, when allocated to a single activity, we see that firing rate is constant, but in phase coherence of firing leads to a higher frequency (gamma) oscillation, with better cognitive and behavioral activity. When you attend to a stimulus, you increase gamma synchronization and decrease alpha in superficial layers. This is true in every visual processing pathway. So from this we see that attention enhances synchronicity between brain structures, and after a point, drops ego with it. Many define ‘Genius’ by an ability to hold an extraordinary degree of attention for long periods of time to a given task. (Again, what other than love for a topic can do this?) The synchronization of firing from this egoless, spectacularly focused attention must be the key here, and we know in flow states, attention is paramount. It is an active meditation of sorts, where attention is optimal and learning occurs most quickly and strongly. Geniuses alike are humble people. This is because they’ll tell you they didn’t think of their most brilliant ideas or consciously perform their most brilliant actions. The ideas/actions simply came to them, as if injected from a universal bank into their awareness. Vindicating this further, recently in 2016, San Francisco State University performed a study which found that complex ideas can enter consciousness automatically. </p>\n<p>Selen Atasoy wrote a paper called “Consciousness with Connectome-specific Harmonic Waves,” where “We found that structured oscillatory patterns naturally self-organize on the human connectome for a wide-range of diffusion parameters in the model. &#8230;we observed a decrease in the frequency of coherent oscillations when excitatory activity is decreased, modelled by slower diffusion of excitation, or when inhibitory activity is increased, modelled by faster diffusion of inhibition in the neural field model.&#8221; Again, here we see less excitability, which can be looked at as attention in this context, decreases frequency of oscillation, moving us away from gamma consciousness. We can imagine it is the inhibition – our agency of ‘free-wont’ or egoic neglect – which can do this.<br />\nHans-Peter Dürr, head of Germany&#8217;s Max Planck Institute of Physics, suggested it is the electromagnetic radiation surrounding electrons in a bio molecules that gives a living organism its coherence. Dürr’s suggestion may not be far off the mark, as Yale neuroscientist David A. McCormick collaborated with Haider and Fröhlich to come to a similar conclusion. They found  &#8220;Whether or not these field potentials may also influence local neuronal network activity is still unknown, although the close apposition of pyramidal cell apical dendrites may provide one avenue for synchronization through local fields&#8221; Thus, neocortical neuronal networks may not only be defined by their anatomical interconnectivity and the status of the synaptic activity that binds them together but also by the spatially and temporally complex EFs in which they are embedded.” (Haider &amp; McCormick, 2009), (Fröhlich &amp; McCormick, 2010). These scientists found a feedback between brain activity and the endogenous electric field the brain creates. So unavoidably we crash into the possibility that even the thoughts and brain activity we experience are founded, at least in part, by the frequency of oscillation we are emanating. Therefore, coherent thoughts, including the ones of brilliance, are a potential byproduct of synchronistic electromagnetic movement of our brain’s endogenous electromagnetic field. And as we’ve seen, the ego is absolutely deleterious to an optimal natural rhythm. </p>\n<p>Lastly, I’d like to bring attention to a 2014 study by Flavio Frohlich’s team, which found that weak, exogenously applied electric fields only significantly augmented our endogenous electric field when frequency of stimulation was consonant or at a harmonic of the endogenous frequency. In this way it seems that the information we store as truth exists at a particular frequency which is perceptible in others who share it, from an excitation/strengthening of one’s own knowing by the other. Recall back to the introduction, where empathy was looked at as a knowing of truth by an interpersonal mental resonance. Now from the Ego section, where Jonathan Haidt pointed out groups precipitate from differentiating truths. The mutual truths (i.e. intra-group resonance derived from a common subjective tenet) effectively bind these people together. And as we know, for some of the deepest truths, e.g. existential truth, a desire for vindication via resonance in others is critical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“For the weaker resonances, it can be argued that the widespread possession of a resonance of whatever strength aids neurons in the integration of their inputs. In effect, the establishment of even a weak resonance makes a neuron a good listener for activity within a specialized frequency band. A host of good listeners, mutually connected, should tune networks to operate in frequency ranges of special biological meaning.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p> Hutcheon, B., &amp; Yarom, Y. (2000). <em>Resonance, oscillation and the intrinsic frequency preferences of neurons</em>. Here we see Hutcheon and Yarom posit that the specific frequency of a resonance attunes other brain parts to allow a connection to be made, specific to a biological state. The ego can be seen as the out-of-tune trumpet disorganizing an orchestra’s symphony. Its silencing allows for a deeper listening, and a wider breadth of brain functioning. The ego’s interruption &#8211; for its own prerogative &#8211; will never listen intently to the tune of possibility, for its mere presence precludes the experience.  </p>\n<p>Our brain’s default mode network was found to be activated when our core values are considered. As we know, our biases refract awareness, rather than reflect it. We naturally, usually unconsciously, superimpose conception to our experience, augmenting it. Stephen LaBerge uses experience of highest &#8216;potential&#8217; synonymously with least egoic skew. Even intuitively, we see others are getting at this same idea, and have been for thousands of years, as seen in the early concepts of Wu-Wei and Sunyata, and the more recent concept of Flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Thought as an interconnected process of EM feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Even thought is controlled by a higher principle. As we now understand in the feedback of electromagnetic oscillation on brain activity, we can extrapolate this same idea to any interaction. In dialogue between two people, there exists two biochemical oscillators throwing waves at one another. The endogenous waves are undoubtedly augmented by the oncoming ones, and this is true for both parties. What changes, though, is the information embedded in these volleys, which determines directionality of conversation. This can be viewed as a constellation of thoughts and emotions which manifests itself in consciousness as an attitude which elicits a certain energy field. </p>\n<p>I postulate that we can empirically observe synchronization as it occurs in dialogue when a mutual truth is perceived by both parties, and a subsequent resonance-induced spike in an EEG signal results from this acknowledgement of understanding. Understanding creates a form of ecstasy, and this profound joy can vindicate the understanding. Einstein said conceiving the theory of relativity was the happiest thought of his life. Though his resonance of subjective truth rang much deeper into the cosmic sink of information, far beyond a transfer between two people. Any flash of insight works in this way. Yuri Lazebnik studies communication and came to the same realization, though by different means. He studied the state of brain coupling, or &#8220;cumulative flow&#8221; between two people when they clicked, and could even finish the other&#8217;s words as their brain patterning was mimicked. He therefore realized that the individualistic talking vs. listening isn&#8217;t as true as it may seem. “Communication is a singular act encompassing two brains.” <a href=\"http://nptel.ac.in/pdf/demyst_combined_dec2012.pdf\">http://nptel.ac.in/pdf/demyst_combined_dec2012.pdf</a><br />\nMimicked patterning occurs in every encounter. Riveted audiences who are listening to a curator are actually mimicking the brain activity of the speaker via their mirror neurons. We become entranced in a single signal. One may even consider intelligence as the ability to effectively curate a collective consciousness, to sway the most energy to your specific state, e.g. truth. This is the act of eliciting an electromagnetic conscious field so powerful that it trumps the fields that oppose it and subsequently collapses more fields into it. (A phenomenon seen in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imagining). Remember, if there is a feedback loop of EM on brain activity, those who agree with a speaker, athlete, etc. are mimicking his activity in their own mental state and perhaps subsequently increasing the vigor of the performer’s own act. When an audience is repulsed by a phenomenon, you’ll find performance of the act is lackluster.  Similarity facilities cohesion. And passion is one of the strongest conscious forces. Magical things emerge from grouping people together who all share a common passion. (Festivals, political rallies, etc.). So perhaps a cumulative willingness to see a good show will enable a good show to come. As David R Hawkins stated, </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Great attractors create context. The motives which arise from one&#8217;s principles to which one is committed, determines one&#8217;s capacity to understand and attribute significance.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> Having such a visceral passion increases the ability to entrance an audience. This can be considered speaking from the soul, as the Taoists have noted, where others can’t help but taste the righteousness of the actions performed. Doing so, as the greats do, compel a consent of its viewers, as to submit the viewers’ field pattern into a synchronization that mimics this specific style of processing, decision making, and virtuosity of the performer.</p>\n<p><strong>Symmetry</strong></p>\n<p>The laws of the universe are symmetrical – physicists have shown us this. Empathy and reciprocity are also symmetrical. Symmetrical interactions send the moral message &#8220;we are all the same,&#8221; while asymmetrical interactions may send the message &#8220;I am special; better than you.” This is at an interpersonal level, as too is the inherent attractiveness of symmetry in faces. On a chemical level, pharmaceutical companies strive to create molecules minimizing unwanted side effects. It is important to highlight the relationship between molecular geometry and bioactivity. The concept of “chiral toxicology” is explored by chemists, who look at the diverse impact of chirality on multiple aspects of toxicology. To do this, appropriate chiral antidotes must be selected for therapeutic benefit and to minimize adverse events. This isn’t so much about the symmetry of the molecule, as most of biomolecules are chiral, but about the chemicals having the proper chiral configuration to coalesce with its receptor site. “Chirally correct” is the term required for a good drug, i.e. one that mimics the lock and key manner of natural products. In pharmaceuticals, we typically see only one enantiomer of a racemic drug as effective and therapeutic. The second enantiomer does not have the desired therapeutic affect and may actually have an adverse toxic effect. For this reason, optical purity is critical. </p>\n<p>Consciousness is the same way. Manly P. Hall stated, “experiences are the chemicals with which the philosopher experiments.” No matter how much you learn, the only way to integrate all of what you are experiencing in your evolution of consciousness is to experience it in your three-dimensional reality.<br />\nFrom synchronization of brain activity, we can understand a symmetric and integrative consciousness to parallel the chemical proclivities of nature. We see nature favors a balanced paradigm, with no residual refuse. This is likely because nature favors the least energy expenditure in creation. The earth is round to minimize gravitational pull, bubbles are round to minimize surface tension energy. An enantiomer that doesn’t bind to a receptor is also wasteful, and the bodily consequence is typically harmful. The act of a molecule reaching and fitting its target receptor site can be looked at several levels of abstraction higher in an individual finding his passion. The energy goes into good use by a natural, instinctual predisposition of nature. The spontaneity of action while engaged in a passion-filled activity is similar to the fluidity of our natural biochemical processes. Forcing a behavior or a synthetic molecule into a receptor site never works quite as well and insinuates that holding a high moral standard creates a reciprocation from the universe. </p>\n<p>We can surmise that minimizing energy in thought should be favored, which likely has a strong negative correlation with our egocentric self-critic. Any enlightened guru will tell you, when thought stops, you’re close. We need to use our own subjective truth to get closest to a perfect symmetry, to a level of enlightenment where the physical has realized its nature. Such a form of existence can only be transcendental, since, as the knowledge of future or spatially distant events shows, it is contained in a psychically relative space and time, that is to say in an irrepresentable space-time continuum. The axiom of relativity inhibits those with an ego from reaching this transcendental state. The ego neglects truth to protect a preexisting ideal it has grouped itself into. As consciousness progresses from an atom to a human, the only thing that evolves is the capacity to know, and the wisest members of society know their truth, or lack thereof.</p>\n<p>Negative emotion (ex: anger, frustration) bring us further from absolute symmetry, as it’s associated with erratic, incoherent patterns, as seen in heart rhythm. Beating patterns change as emotions do, and the endocrine system secretes hormones directly into blood accordingly, which soon enter the central nervous system. Cortisol, for example, is a hormone released during stress, which shortens telomere length and expedites the aging process. Pent up anger, frustration, and jealousy are conducive to cortisol release. The inverse in hearth rhythm is true for positive emotions, and both can be measured via spectral analysis. Sine wave-like pattern are organized, and linked with reduction in mental dialogue, less stress, emotional balance, enhanced clarity, intuition, and cognition.<br />\nA study recently showed attractiveness and dance ability to be positively correlated. A rationalist would dismiss a confounding variable such as the confidence which comes with attractiveness to entirely create this finding, without understanding why such a rationale is arbitrary. Confidence can be seen as attractive because it means one has a high synchronization of neuron firing. Many &#8216;go&#8217; signals from different areas leads to lesser inhibition and more fluid neuronal flow. On the deepest level, synchrony is attractive. If we are patterns of information, it&#8217;s quantified, and the greatly patterned are genetically attractive. (Born into a quantity). Even phenotype is a pattern of DNA expression, with symmetrical pattern being selected for. Neural firing and phenotypic make up are one in the same: a higher capacity for harmony.</p>\n<p>Beauty is aligning external truth with internal truth. An instrumental purpose of beauty is attraction. A beautiful object is beautiful to people who appreciate the beauty. (Genetically agree/resonate, like pheromones do). Though as David Deutsche has pointed out, the beauty isn&#8217;t in the content of the information, it&#8217;s in the form. (E.g. music <em>represents</em> an emotion). It is not the sound of language, but the meaning behind the representation we have for the symbols verbalized, that resonate as truthful. We share feeling states through the similar association of symbols. Inescapably we see something innate within us that longs for cohesion. We want to be understood and we want to understand. As we can see in morality, confidence, facial symmetry, and chemical structure, a cosmic equation whispers  &#8216;good&#8217; in some sense. These qualities even create more harmonious brain waves in those who consent to them. They move the meta-pattern of information we are closer to complete synchronicity. Life doesn&#8217;t just give us sound. It gives us the opportunity to turn our sound into a symphony. Unfortunately excessive pride, stubbornness, jealously, blame, hostility, intolerance, denial, resentment, and separation aren’t conducive to a corroboration of truth. And as poet John Keats has said <em>&#8220;Beauty is truth, truth beauty.”<br />\n</em></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

                "markdown": "\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a Long Distance BFF is Actually the Best For These 4 Reasons</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 Things That Make Your Long Distance BFF Your Best Friend</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a BFF, you’re pretty lucky. Not everyone is blessed with loving friends, let alone one good, amazing friend who always has your back no matter what. I recently stumbled across a BFF of my own and I have to say, it’s a pretty great feeling. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you have a BFF, but he or she lives across the world from you, making your relationship more long distance than anything. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing! </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the closest and most passionate relationships happen at a distance, so if you have a long distance BFF, here are four reasons that they’re so great:</span>\n\n**You don’t have any other choice but to communicate with one another**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because your long distance BFF might not run into you at the store, make a surprise visit to your place of work for some lunch, or get to meet up with you for happy hour on Friday, you have to actually work to communicate with them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you set aside time specifically for them to discuss the important happenings of life. Whether it’s a big promotion at work or a crazy story from the weekend, your communication is valued and genuine.</span>\n\n**They help you see from other perspectives**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s incredibly easy to get so caught up in your own life that you forget there’s an entire world that exists outside of your own. Your long distance BFF, who is outside of it all, knows exactly how to bring you back to a grounded state: they’ll tell you how it is, no sugarcoating. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who only has your best interests in mind, the long distance BFF will always give you real advice when you need it. You don’t need to worry about them having ulterior motives or wanting to stir up drama, because they’re a thousand miles away.</span>\n\n**The time you do get to spend together is priceless**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Reunited and it feels so good’ has never been more accurate than when two long distance BFFs come together after a long time apart. This is definitely one case where absence makes the heart grow fonder. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the two of you talk on the phone regularly, you never run out of things to say and share when you finally meet up in person.</span>\n\n**Your relationship takes work from both of you, work you can be proud of**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every person who’s ever had a BFF knows that it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.

Not everyone is blessed with loving friends, let alone one good, amazing friend who always has your back no matter what. I recently stumbled across a BFF of my own and I have to say, it’s a pretty great feeling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you have a BFF, but he or she lives across the world from you, making your relationship more long distance than anything. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the closest and most passionate relationships happen at a distance, so if you have a long distance BFF, here are four reasons that they’re so great:</span></p>\n<p><b>You don’t have any other choice but to communicate with one another</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because your long distance BFF might not run into you at the store, make a surprise visit to your place of work for some lunch, or get to meet up with you for happy hour on Friday, you have to actually work to communicate with them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you set aside time specifically for them to discuss the important happenings of life. Whether it’s a big promotion at work or a crazy story from the weekend, your communication is valued and genuine.</span></p>\n<p><b>They help you see from other perspectives</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s incredibly easy to get so caught up in your own life that you forget there’s an entire world that exists outside of your own. Your long distance BFF, who is outside of it all, knows exactly how to bring you back to a grounded state: they’ll tell you how it is, no sugarcoating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who only has your best interests in mind, the long distance BFF will always give you real advice when you need it. You don’t need to worry about them having ulterior motives or wanting to stir up drama, because they’re a thousand miles away.</span></p>\n<p><b>The time you do get to spend together is priceless</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Reunited and it feels so good’ has never been more accurate than when two long distance BFFs come together after a long time apart. This is definitely one case where absence makes the heart grow fonder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the two of you talk on the phone regularly, you never run out of things to say and share when you finally meet up in person.</span></p>\n<p><b>Your relationship takes work from both of you, work you can be proud of</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every person who’s ever had a BFF knows that it’s not always sunshine and rainbows. Having good friends isn’t always easy, but it’s almost always worth it. Having that BFF be long distance only adds to the work. You have to want it in order for it work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re content sending a text every now and then when you remember something funny or simply don’t have time to communicate, you’re not showing the other person that you want them in your life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good friends are hard to come by, so if you and your friend put in the time and effort to make it work, that’s something you can both be proud of. So, take the time to let your long distance BFF know just how important they are to you!</span></p>\n<blockquote data-secret=\"IvrihMCBPP\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"http://hellogiggles.com/long-distance-bff-the-best/\">Why long distance BFFS are actually the best</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"http://hellogiggles.com/long-distance-bff-the-best/embed/#?secret=IvrihMCBPP\" data-secret=\"IvrihMCBPP\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Why long distance BFFS are actually the best&#8221; &#8212; HelloGiggles\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

What many people don’t realize is that people aren’t just anxious because they worry too much. And depressed people aren’t just sad for the sake of being sad. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s often something they have no control over. It’s often a mental illness that they struggle to deal with constantly.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve witnessed the pain, frustration, and sadness that comes from fighting mental illness. It’s a terrible combination, feeling like you’re completely helpless and unable to do anything, while simultaneously worrying about </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needing</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do something all the time. They’re contradicting ideals, and they make you want to scream.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s something that they struggle with. Every. Day. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you know someone who struggles with depression or anxiety, here are five things you should avoid saying to them, because they’re tired of hearing them:</span>\n\n**“Are you just going to sit around all day? / Being lazy today, huh?”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that they </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sit around being inactive all day, it’s that literally doing </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anything</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is impossible when you’re paralyzed by the incessant worrying of anxiety and the endless weight of depression. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be encouraging of the things they are able to do and don’t get upset when they don’t share the joy you have for the day.</span>\n\n**“You’re not trying”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you should never force someone to do something they don’t want to do, this advice should be followed tenfold when interacting with the depressed and anxious. You’ll understand after you try, and it results in a panic attack, mental break, overwhelming tears, or a total shut down of the body. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re getting frustrated with them, don’t persecute them for a perceived lack of effort. Just walk away.</span>\n\n**“Cheer Up!”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, of course! Why didn’t I think of that? I should just cheer up. Wrong. Say this to an anxious or depressed person and you’re bound to get punched in the face. Obviously they would love to cheer up and live a life that is cheery and joyful, instead of the dark, gloomy and sorrowful existence that looms over them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happiness isn’t a choice they make at the start of their day. It’s a war to be waged every second they’re awake.</span>\n\n**“You just need to calm down”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as ‘cheer up’ incites anger and frustration for the depressed, ‘calm down’ infuriates those who are anxious. Why do people think that saying these things will work, as if they came up with some novel idea as to how to deal with mental illness. If you were about to get hit by a car, you would be pissed at someone telling you to calm down, right? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s pretty much anxiety, except the car is in your head, and it’s always just about to crash straight into you, but never does.</span>\n\n**“You’re crazy / too emotional / sensitive / overreacting”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, you’re literally describing the symptoms and conditions that depressed and anxious people feel all the time.

But very rarely are these venues ever mentioned again after they’ve served their purpose for the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For whatever reasons, many of these structural amenities are completely forgotten about, never to be used again. But their skeletons still exist, serving as a reminder that, while the games of their time are certainly over, their effect on the environment and the memories they’ve created are still very much alive.</span></p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.boredpanda.com/bobsleigh-track-sarajevo-1984-winter-olympics/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#1 Bobsleigh Track, Sarajevo, 1984 Winter

We have no real way of knowing if authority figures and educational entities are telling us the truth about the world and its history.</span></p>\n<p><b>What if education is designed to force us into a specific system of dependency?</b></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-37169 alignleft shareaholic-media-target-hover-state\" src=\"http://thespiritscience.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tumblr_mm8opmBBPD1soyza9o1_500.gif\" alt=\"tumblr_mm8opmBBPD1soyza9o1_500\" width=\"500\" height=\"210\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a young age, we’re taught how to operate in a bureaucratic manner, always respecting authority and never questioning those above us. Are your goals and dreams unique? Or are they shaped by a specific ideology that’s drilled into your head as a kid?</span></p>\n<p><b>What if gender roles weren’t given out at birth?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babies come into this world with predetermined names, sets of toys and clothing, and expectations in society. But what if gender wasn’t a social construct? What if we perceived the only difference between genders as being entirely physical, rather than dividing people up?</span></p>\n<p><b>What if we </b><b><i>are</i></b><b> the only form of intelligent life in the cosmos?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, what if we’re not? Is it worse to be all alone in this grand universe or know that there is life all around us and not be able to reach it? Maybe there is other intelligent life out there, but they want to destroy mankind. What would they even look and act like?</span></p>\n<p><b>What if God was the end-all-be-all?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the implications of God being the creator of space and time itself? What if this God was omnipotent, omniscient, genderless, and within every living soul on the planet? What if God is the culmination of everything that is and once was?</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

This is partly because the standard combination of pharmaceutical drugs and mainstream psychology struggles to work. Fortunately, there are other ways though.\n\nBefore I get into how, let’s discuss why the drugs and psychs aren’t doing what they say they will. To use a pharmacological example, the anti-depressant drugs that the corporate-based, medical-industrial complex prescribes for society are designed to increase the levels of serotonin in the body. Yet as discussed in **[this Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/how-anti-depressants-work_n_6707272)**, that entire theory might be invalid:\n\n*Andrews surveyed 50 years’ worth of research supporting the [serotonin theory of depression](http://jdc.jefferson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1367&context=jeffjpsychiatry), which suggests that the disease is caused by low levels of the “happiness” neurotransmitter, serotonin.*\n\n*But Andrews argues that depression may actually be caused by elevated levels of serotonin. And this fundamental misunderstanding may be responsible for inappropriate treatment.*\n\nEven if increasing serotonin was the right approach, it’s only a temporary support mechanism whilst psycho-social and physiological measures are put into place to actually resolve the problem permanently. In other words, these drugs don’t cure anything. What will cure it is holistically addressing the issues in our neurological, digestive, environmental and philosophical realms. This in turn can emancipate us from our depression, anxiety and an array of other mental and emotional ills.\n\nFor example, anxiety and depression appear to be linked to poor gut health. This is definitely not the only reason why people feel stressed and sad, yet it is basic instinct to recognize that a toxic diet which causes a toxic digestive system certainly makes it more challenging to feel good.\n\nAs stated in [t**his article**](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/can-the-bacteria-in-your-gut-explain-your-mood.html?_r=0):\n\n*Micro-organisms in our gut secrete a profound number of chemicals, and researchers like Lyte have found that among those chemicals are the same substances used by our neurons to communicate and regulate mood, like dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These, in turn, appear to play a function in intestinal disorders, which coincide with high levels of major depression and anxiety.*\n\nAnd as explained in [**this articl**e](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/06/can-inflammation-in-this-organ-be-at-the-root-of-your-depression.aspx):\n\n*Depression is often found alongside gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2-diabetes and also cancer, in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor. Thus researchers suggested “depression may be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome.”*\n\nThe addictive and health-deteriorating substance called sugar has also been linked to depressive psychological states. It’s no wonder either when it has been scientifically shown to light up the same regions of the brain as cocaine and heroin. As expressed in the same article:\n\n*It’s become increasingly clear that one route by which sugar is so detrimental to your mental health is because sugar consumption triggers a cascade of chemical reactions in your body that promote chronic inflammation. Further, excess sugar and fructose will distort the ratio of good to bad bacteria in your gut, which also [plays an integral role in your mental health](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/21/this-supplement-can-actually-make-you-happy.aspx). Sugar does this by serving as a fertilizer/fuel for pathogenic bacteria, yeast and fungi that negatively inhibit the beneficial bacteria in your gut.*\n\nOn a positive side-note, [this article](http://www.livescience.com/49248-gut-bacteria-mental-health.html) indicates how to make our digestive system healthier:\n\n*A new study from England found that supplements that boost “good” bacteria in the gut (called “prebiotics”) may alter the way people process emotional information, suggesting that changes in gut bacteria may have anti-anxiety effects.*\n\nIn terms of our environmental stimuli, our external circumstances are highly influential when it comes to our sense of well-being and the way we behave. When discussed in the context of addiction, the old idea that ‘*drugs cause addiction*’ dissolves and the new approach becomes ‘*challenging environments amplify addictive **behavior*’. One such study with rats reinforces this idea [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html):\n\n*The experiment is simple. Put a rat in a cage, alone, with two water bottles. One is just water. The other is water laced with heroin or cocaine. Almost every time you run this experiment, the rat will become obsessed with the drugged water, and keep coming back for more and more, until it kills itself.*\n\n*But in the 1970s, a professor of Psychology in Vancouver called Bruce Alexander noticed something odd about this experiment. The rat is put in the cage all alone. It has nothing to do but take the drugs. What would happen, he wondered, if we tried this differently? So Professor Alexander built Rat Park. It is a lush cage where the rats would have colored balls and the best rat-food and tunnels to scamper down and plenty of friends: everything a rat about town could want. What, Alexander wanted to know, will happen then?*\n\n*In Rat Park, all the rats obviously tried both water bottles, because they didn’t know what was in them. But what happened next was startling.*\n\n*The rats with good lives didn’t like the drugged water. They mostly shunned it, consuming less than a quarter of the drugs the isolated rats used. None of them died. While all the rats who were alone and unhappy became heavy users, none of the rats who had a happy environment did.*\n\nThere is no doubt that an unhealthy environment – including poor parental, interpersonal, financial and societal circumstances – all contribute to our state of being, but why can some people exposed to poverty and other harsh realities still manage to be relatively happy?\n\nMoreover, why aren’t all people with unhealthy guts experiencing depression and/or anxiety? What are the other reasons why so many people are subjected to these ongoing states of suffering?\n\nIt’s not just the outside of us which comprises our environment, our inner realm is just as much as part of it too. This includes our physical design, such as our neurology, and our mental design, such as our beliefs and philosophies.\n\nThat’s why if we truly want to overcome our states of suffering, we need to go back to the way we’re wired neurologically and the way we’re constructed conceptually. The wiring in our body-brain is an interconnected network that not just moves through our cerebral, digestive and heart brains, but also throughout our body in terms of cellular, molecular and atomic information-sharing and processing. These pathways and reference points are the physiological basis of our past – our memory – which in effect influences our present and future.\n\nIn other words, our traumas and other dysfunctions are hardwired through this network, leading to the continuation of past habits, including depressive and anxious responses to our world. So if we want to change a habit of say, poor resilience, we need to change ourselves on a physical level to ensure sustained behavioral change.\n\nSo then, how exactly do we do that? Enter philosophy and action. The way we conceptualize reality, including our lives in detail, as well as the choices we make which determine our behavior, directly impacts the neurological pathways and connections in our body, especially over time.\n\nI can’t emphasize how important this point is. Just like our physical layer influences our mental experience, the way we construct our internal world of ideas, concepts and beliefs inevitably has an impact on our body-brain. If we consistently and repeatedly force a new way of thinking and feeling onto our bodily system, it will respond and adapt accordingly without fail.\n\nA good analogy I like to use when describing this is when you create a new path through the forest. The old walkway is obvious and therefore easy to navigate through, but a new one isn’t. Over considerable time walking the new path it will inescapably become as easy to navigate as the original one.\n\nTherefore, when we change our internal dialogue, our neurology and other physiology changes with it.\n\nThat’s why it’s seriously important to *consciously* design our philosophies and actions i.e. what we believe, how we think, the decisions we make, which ways we behave etc. We should always be asking ourselves: is our internal design beneficial to our mental and emotional health? Does it translate into productive, functional and beneficial behaviors? Is our conscious and subconscious awareness healthy for our physical apparatus, or does it impact negatively on our body-brain?\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIf you’re personally stuck in a rut with anxiety, depression or other forms of mental and physical health issues, taking a holistic approach to resolving them is the only way. Just changing what we eat, or just thinking more positively, isn’t going to cut it; it needs to a full spectrum response over a significant course of time if we really want to redesign our mind/body connection in a more productive and desirable way.\n\nTo do so, we must face ourselves on every level. This includes our interpersonal, physical, emotional, philosophical, psychological, behavioral, sexual and spiritual health, as well as how they all interrelate and dance with each other.\n\nAnd we also need to respect the emotional roller-coaster we call life and navigate our way through the happiness and sadness with as much peace and contentment as we can can.\n\nUltimately, keep your chin up; we’ve all had not-so wise influences throughout our upbringing and within society in general, so we all need to go through various phases of unlearning and relearning. It might take a while to implement hard-wired, habitual and sustained changes that are valuable for our overall health, but with enough commitment, courage and creativity, it’s achievable for all of us.\n\nMuch love, Phil…\n\n**ABOUT THE AUTHOR**\n\n**Phillip J.

This includes our interpersonal, physical, emotional, philosophical, psychological, behavioral, sexual and spiritual health, as well as how they all interrelate and dance with each other.</p>\n<p>And we also need to respect the emotional roller-coaster we call life and navigate our way through the happiness and sadness with as much peace and contentment as we can can.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, keep your chin up; we’ve all had not-so wise influences throughout our upbringing and within society in general, so we all need to go through various phases of unlearning and relearning. It might take a while to implement hard-wired, habitual and sustained changes that are valuable for our overall health, but with enough commitment, courage and creativity, it’s achievable for all of us.</p>\n<p>Much love, Phil…</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phillip J.

Because switching burns up all of the oxygenated glucose we store in the brain for later use, like when we need to focus on one specific task.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That switching comes with a biological cost that ends up making us feel tired much more quickly than if we sustain attention on one thing,” says McGill University professor of behavioral neuroscience, Daniel Levitin. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People eat more, they take more caffeine.

From stunning pieces of artwork, to the tallest buildings we’ve ever seen, to our ability to move our bodies in ways that seem impossible. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dancing is something that not everyone can do. While I enjoy moving my body to music, I understand that my dance moves are terrible. Then there are people like Valeriy and Yulia, two Ukranian dancers who do things I never even thought were possible. Blurring the lines between gymnastics, acrobatics and dancing, these two move together in bizarrely beautiful and fluid ways.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the two can be seen standing completely still, as if knowing that what they were about to do next would blow the minds of those watching them.

                "markdown": "\nBy [**Andrea Schulman**](https://www.facebook.com/raiseyourvibrationtoday/?fref=ts) | [**Raise Your Vibration Today **](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/05/feeling-provoked-your-best-defense/)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Often, people will treat you with love and kindness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>But what do you do when they don’t? How do you respond when someone says something hurtful, does something mean or tries to provoke you? What’s your best defense?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I used to believe in retaliation, so I used to stand my ground, and fight back passionately in self-defense. However, over the years I’ve realized that retaliation is totally ineffective. It has about a 0% chance of reducing provocation.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, today, here’s what I try to do instead.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I take a deep breath, and I do my best to let it go. I know that if I can find a way to let go, things will work out for the best every time.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I let whomever wants to hurt me or offend me throw their dagger, I pull it out, and I do my best to get on with my life. I remind myself that the best thing I can do is rise above the provocation without retaliation.</span>\n\nDoes this sound this make me sound weak? Maybe so, but I’m not and I know this strategy works, so I’m ok with that perception. Here’s why your best defense is no defense at all:\n\n\n## Why People Hurt Us\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We may think that the world is out to get us sometimes, but it’s not. Our world, after all, is simply a mirror of our own beliefs and expectations, thanks to the [Law of Attraction](http://www.raiseyourvibrationtoday.com \"Raise Your Vibration Today: Law of Attraction Education\").</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">People only hurt us because of *our own* expectations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We expect certain people to treat us poorly, and as a result, they do. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When we label people in our lives as toxic or negative, they usually deliver.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Fortunately, though, the same is true for the people we label as loving and kind!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So I can get as mad as I want to when someone mistreats me, but I know that ultimately, I attract everything into my reality.</span>\n\n\n## Shouldn’t I Defend Myself?\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Now, this doesn’t mean that we should just allow ourselves to be punching bags, or we should encourage people to treat us like crap.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It may sound like that’s what I’m saying, but what I’m saying *actually** means quite the opposite.*</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When we engage in retaliation, we actually *encourage* people to treat us poorly. While many people think you have to “defend” yourself, in defending yourself you really only expose yourself to more mistreatment in the future. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When we fight back and throw our own daggers, we almost certainly insure there will be return fire.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> So i</span>f you want to continue receiving blow after blow, retaliation is your best plan of action.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Retaliation, in the end, isn’t your best defense. It isn’t any kind of defense at all. It doesn’t protect you, it endangers you.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After all, if someone was willing to hurt you in the first place, they’re probably waiting on pins and needles for a new reason to hurt you again. Why offer it up to them on a silver platter?</span>\n\n\n## How Do You Prefer to Be Treated?\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As for me? I like being treated with kindness and respect. I prefer for people to smile at me, give me hugs and positive feedback.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>That feels better to me. That’s what I want as often as I can get it. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I like nice drivers, polite cashiers and friendly servers. I like friends who care about me. I like family members who make me feel safe.</span>\n\n***Related Article:**[How to Attract Positive Relationships (& Drop the Negative Ones Too!)](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/09/23/how-to-attract-positive-relationships/ \"How to Attrat Positive Relationships & Drop the Negative Ones Too!\")*\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So when someone throws a rock, I let it hit me, I lick my wounds, and then I do my best let it go. I don’t push back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I know that in retaliating, I only create more drama and negativity in my life. I’ve seen firsthand that when I retaliate, I only get hurt more in the end.</span>\n\n\n## No Defense Is the Best Defense\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Many people disagree with this philosophy and they believe that the best defense is to overpower your aggressor. To put it bluntly, this is just the ego talking. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Your greatest strength doesn’t come from hurting other people more than they hurt you.  Your greatest strength comes from your ability to face and let go of your pain, without letting it control your life.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I know for certain that no defense is the best defense. There’s a reason why 99% of the comments on my blog and my Facebook page are positive and friendly.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Even people who disagree with something I’ve said often write their responses politely. Usually, a reader who disagrees writes in with the intention of sharing his or her perspective, rather than cramming it down my throat. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Why? Trolls always get a kind response and a well-wish.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I refuse to pick up the rope someone else is throwing down. Anyone who comes to my page or site gets treated with respect, so it’s received by me in turn.</span>\n\n\n## Let it Go\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So if you’re feeling provoked, remember take a deep breath. Just because you’ve been hurt once doesn’t mean you have to be hurt again.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remember, your best defense is no defense.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Rise above it. Refuse to engage. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The wrong people will either change their tune or they’ll float right out of your life. Those who are looking for a fight just aren’t interested in peace. I promise you, if you represent peace, love and acceptance, the provokers of the world won’t want anything to do with you.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Be a magnet for positive, loving people. Put down the rope, breathe, and let go. The only defense you will ever need is to stand squarely in the light.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span>\n\n*(Law of Attraction coach & educator)*\n\n### Are you a student of the Law of Attraction?\n\nSign up for my free [Law of Attraction newsletter](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&id=db39a47128 \"subscribe\") for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.  You can also become a member of my LOA member website and gain access to a library of video tutorials, ebooks, audiobooks and meditations.  Learn how to attract the things you want with fun, clarity and success!   Join today for as little as[ $1.99](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=1 \"become a member for just $1.99!\") or become an annual member for [30% in savings](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=2 \"annual member\").\n\n*Article Source: This article was originally published at [Raise Your Vibration Today](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/05/feeling-provoked-your-best-defense/) and has been republished with permission from the author.*\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

Look back in your own life and notice how often you have gone through the same experience.*  \n>  ~ Louise Hay\n\n   \n Limiting beliefs are like heavy bags, filled with useless stuff, that you carry with you wherever you go.\n\nYou may think that whatever you’re carrying in those bags is important, but the bags ultimately weigh you down and greatly restrict your mobility. There’s also the aspect of becoming accustomed to carrying the bags. Once you do it for a while, it becomes your default state. You don’t know any better, so you go around carrying your baggage without ever stopping to ask, *“Wait, what am I doing?”*\n\nLimiting beliefs are insidious because you don’t really know that they exist until you’re able to objectively look at yourself. It’s like the old phrase, *“The fish will be the last to discover water.”* Until you’re able to observe your thoughts, emotions and actions, you’ll forever be confined within a bubble reality of limiting beliefs and disempowering false assumptions.\n\nMany of the limiting beliefs we hold are learned from our parents. As children, we are subconscious sponges, constantly picking up beliefs, habits, behavioral patterns and general views of the world from our parents. This is how our model of reality is sculpted, for better or worse. (See: [Face It, You’re Parents are Flawed](http://www.feelingoodfeelingreat.com/2016/07/12/face-it-your-parents-are-flawed/)).\n\n**The Power of Mindfulness**\n\nI cannot stress the importance of mindfulness enough.\n\nIn order to be able to view yourself objectively and even have the option to change, you must cultivate mindfulness.\n\nThink of mindfulness as self-awareness from a higher perspective, or the ability to objectively observe your thoughts, emotions and actions.\n\nMindfulness is the basis of any change. It is the foundational phenomena that, once, cultivated, will put you in a position of power to change anything. Instead of unknowingly repeating limiting or negative patterns on auto-pilot, mindfulness gives you the choice in every moment to indulge those patterns or not ([and choice is a superpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL6AW7tMpZw)).\n\nIf you develop mindfulness, you will be in a position to intuitively discover and release anything that’s holding you back. With enough mastery, *you won’t need any external information*. If you can still the waters of your mind and just listen, you’ll be able to receive all of the answers you need. Remember that.\n\nMindfulness is cultivated through a regular meditation practice. It doesn’t have to be anything complicated or time consuming either. The notion that meditation has to be difficult is actually a limiting belief that many people have. You can start just by sitting with your eyes closed and observing your thoughts for 2 minutes every day. Just 2 minutes! Another ridiculously easy practice is the [21 Breath Salute](http://www.feelingoodfeelingreat.com/2016/03/31/change-your-life-in-21-breaths/). Once you feel like you’re able to consistently watch your thoughts and they appear less and less, you can extend the time or try out other forms of meditation. Don’t be intimidated by the idea of meditation; even the shortest and simplest daily practice will be greatly transformative over time.\n\n**A Simple 5 Step Process For Releasing Limiting Beliefs**\n\n**1. Ask Questions and Embark on a Scavenger Hunt**\n\n> *Your limiting decisions are hiding out in the areas where you’re producing results that you don’t want.*  \n> [~ Matthew B. James](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/focus-forgiveness/201311/4-steps-release-limiting-beliefs-learned-childhood)\n\n   \n Your limiting beliefs are the shadows lurking beneath the results you’re getting that you don’t want. So here’s the big question to identify limiting beliefs: **What results are you getting that you don’t want?** This can apply to any and every aspect of life.\n\nIf you’re having money problems, for example, chances are that you’re holding a limiting belief around money. So ask yourself these kinds of questions to get to the bottom of it:\n\n19. *What is my self-talk regarding money? (Maybe it’s something like “There’s never enough money.”) And in what situations does this negative self-talk come up?*\n20. How am I reacting to my financial situation? A feeling of helplessness? A victim mentality? Anger?\nHint: If you’re reacting to your situation in a disempowered way, that’s a telltale sign of a limiting belief.\n\nIf you’re having problems finding a relationship, there’s probably a limiting belief standing in the way. Here are some ideas of questions to ask yourself regarding this:\n\n23. *Do I think all women are (insert negative adjective)? Do I think all men are (insert negative adjective)?*\n24. Do I think that women only interested in X? Do I think that men only interested in Y?\n25. Am I waiting for perfection?\n26. Do I not want to settle down yet?\n27. Do I not feel worthy of a good relationship?\nUse these types of questions for any facet of life that you wish to release limiting beliefs. You’ll be surprised at how much you can uncover just by asking the right questions.\n\nA major part of releasing limiting beliefs is treating it like an internal scavenger hunt. You have to be honest with yourself and willing to make a change. Adding elements of gamification and viewing the process as a scavenger hunt makes it more fun and less intimidating.  \n*  \n Note: Choose one specific limiting belief at a time for the rest of the steps. Focusing on one belief at a time will help create a deep awareness regarding that belief and allow you to effectively and fully eliminate it.*\n\n**2. Write down the limiting belief.**\n\nWriting something down leverages the power of externalization. There’s something magical and cathartic about getting something out of your head and into written form. If you write your limiting beliefs down, it will give you perspective, objectivity and insight that you never would have imagined if you had just kept everything in your head.\n\n**3. Recognize that it is a belief, not necessarily truth.**\n\nThis is crucial to understand; just because you believe something doesn’t make it true. Viewing beliefs from this perspective is transformative in and of itself.\n\n> *Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.*  \n>  ~ Marcus Aurelius\n\n   \n**4. Change your thoughts until the belief changes (belief transmutation).**\n\nThe most effective way to get rid of limiting beliefs is to replace them with more empowering beliefs.\n\nA belief is simply a thought that you think over and over again. With mindfulness you can observe and change your thoughts. If you change a thought consistently, then you’ve changed a belief!\n\nAffirmations are immensely useful here. Let’s go back to the limiting belief regarding money, *“There’s never enough money.”* Every time you say *“There’s never enough money,”**“I don’t have the money,”* or anything like that (to yourself or out loud), change it to something like one of the following affirmations:\n\n39. *I always have more than enough money to meet my needs, wants and desires.*\n40. I delight in the financial security that is a constant in my life.\n41. I am open and receptive to all the wealth in the Universe.\n42. I always attract whatever I need for a glorious future.\n43. Money comes to me easily and effortlessly.\n44. Wealth constantly flows into my life.\n45. My actions create constant prosperity.\n46. I am aligned with the energy of abundance.\n   \n Find an affirmation that intuitively feels right for you or create your own based upon the specific limiting belief you wish to replace.\n\nConsistency is key with this practice. Continuously substitute limiting self-talk for more empowering self-talk and soon enough your belief will be transmuted.\n\n**5. Consciously change your actions based on the new belief.**\n\nHow would you act if you had this new belief? Act that way. It’s as simple as that. Act like the belief you want is your reality until it actually becomes your reality.\n\nUsing the example of limiting beliefs around money again, changing your actions doesn’t necessarily mean spending extravagantly. It can be as simple as expressing gratitude (and not guilt) whenever you do spend money. It can also consist of staying open to and actively pursuing more income, instead of just complaining about your lack of money. Another strategy is to not let money be the biggest factor in determining everything you do. For example, if you’re really craving almond butter, splurge and get the expensive almond butter without worrying that it costs $5 more than you usually spend. If you don’t let money control your decisions (while using discretion, of course), then guess what? Money won’t control your decisions.\n\nDo you think you’re weak? Start acting like you’re strong, lift some weights and you’ll gain strength every week. Do you think you’re a bad writer? Write every day, and after a year, you’ll be a better writer than anyone you know. Do you think you’re bad at talking to men/women (whoever you’re attracted to)? Approach 100 people in the next month and you’ll be smoother than a frictionless surface after that. Do you see the trend here?\n\nClarity comes through action. The car has to be in motion in order for the steering to work.\n\nYou can’t sit around and do nothing, expecting your life to magically change. You have to meet the Universe half-way through your actions. Visualize the action and actualize the vision.\n\n*Note: Do steps 4-5 simultaneously until the limiting belief has been transmuted into a more empowering belief. This may take a day or two for some, or as long as a month or more for deeply ingrained beliefs.*\n\n[![Abundance](http://www.feelingoodfeelingreat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Abundance.png)](http://www.feelingoodfeelingreat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Abundance.png)  \n    \n**The Paths Are Infinite**\n\nThere are also strategies that have the potential of helping you to spontaneously release limiting beliefs.

Thinking that there is only one way to achieve something is a limiting belief in and of itself (wink, wink).\n\nBurst through the bubbles of limitation and embrace all possibility.\n\nMuch love.\n\n– Stevie P  \n    \n**ABOUT THE AUTHOR**\n\nStephen Parato (aka Stevie P) is your friendly, neighborhood Earth traveler, intuitive coach, Reiki master, Siddha healer, kinesiologist, philosopher, writer, poet and positivity connoisseur.

Look back in your own life and notice how often you have gone through the same experience.</em><br />\n~ Louise Hay</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nLimiting beliefs are like heavy bags, filled with useless stuff, that you carry with you wherever you go.</p>\n<p>You may think that whatever you’re carrying in those bags is important, but the bags ultimately weigh you down and greatly restrict your mobility. There’s also the aspect of becoming accustomed to carrying the bags. Once you do it for a while, it becomes your default state. You don’t know any better, so you go around carrying your baggage without ever stopping to ask, <em>“Wait, what am I doing?”</em></p>\n<p>Limiting beliefs are insidious because you don’t really know that they exist until you’re able to objectively look at yourself. It’s like the old phrase, <em>“The fish will be the last to discover water.”</em> Until you’re able to observe your thoughts, emotions and actions, you’ll forever be confined within a bubble reality of limiting beliefs and disempowering false assumptions.</p>\n<p>Many of the limiting beliefs we hold are learned from our parents. As children, we are subconscious sponges, constantly picking up beliefs, habits, behavioral patterns and general views of the world from our parents. This is how our model of reality is sculpted, for better or worse. (See: <a href=\"http://www.feelingoodfeelingreat.com/2016/07/12/face-it-your-parents-are-flawed/\" target=\"_blank\">Face It, You’re Parents are Flawed</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>The Power of Mindfulness</strong></p>\n<p>I cannot stress the importance of mindfulness enough.</p>\n<p>In order to be able to view yourself objectively and even have the option to change, you must cultivate mindfulness.</p>\n<p>Think of mindfulness as self-awareness from a higher perspective, or the ability to objectively observe your thoughts, emotions and actions.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness is the basis of any change. It is the foundational phenomena that, once, cultivated, will put you in a position of power to change anything. Instead of unknowingly repeating limiting or negative patterns on auto-pilot, mindfulness gives you the choice in every moment to indulge those patterns or not (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL6AW7tMpZw\" target=\"_blank\">and choice is a superpower</a>).</p>\n<p>If you develop mindfulness, you will be in a position to intuitively discover and release anything that’s holding you back. With enough mastery, <em>you won’t need any external information</em>. If you can still the waters of your mind and just listen, you’ll be able to receive all of the answers you need. Remember that.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness is cultivated through a regular meditation practice. It doesn’t have to be anything complicated or time consuming either. The notion that meditation has to be difficult is actually a limiting belief that many people have. You can start just by sitting with your eyes closed and observing your thoughts for 2 minutes every day. Just 2 minutes! Another ridiculously easy practice is the <a href=\"http://www.feelingoodfeelingreat.com/2016/03/31/change-your-life-in-21-breaths/\" target=\"_blank\">21 Breath Salute</a>. Once you feel like you’re able to consistently watch your thoughts and they appear less and less, you can extend the time or try out other forms of meditation. Don’t be intimidated by the idea of meditation; even the shortest and simplest daily practice will be greatly transformative over time.</p>\n<p><strong>A Simple 5 Step Process For Releasing Limiting Beliefs</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Ask Questions and Embark on a Scavenger Hunt</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Your limiting decisions are hiding out in the areas where you’re producing results that you don’t want.</em><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/focus-forgiveness/201311/4-steps-release-limiting-beliefs-learned-childhood\" target=\"_blank\">~ Matthew B. James</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nYour limiting beliefs are the shadows lurking beneath the results you’re getting that you don’t want. So here&#8217;s the big question to identify limiting beliefs: <strong>What results are you getting that you don&#8217;t want?</strong> This can apply to any and every aspect of life.</p>\n<p>If you’re having money problems, for example, chances are that you’re holding a limiting belief around money. So ask yourself these kinds of questions to get to the bottom of it:</p>\n<li><em>What is my self-talk regarding money? (Maybe it&#8217;s something like “There’s never enough money.”) And in what situations does this negative self-talk come up?</li>\n<li>How am I reacting to my financial situation? A feeling of helplessness? A victim mentality? Anger?</em></li>\n<p>Hint: If you&#8217;re reacting to your situation in a disempowered way, that&#8217;s a telltale sign of a limiting belief.</p>\n<p>If you’re having problems finding a relationship, there’s probably a limiting belief standing in the way.

Plastic is something that continues to fill the world around us at an alarming rate. In fact, researchers estimate that by 2050, almost 100 percent of birds on the planet will have at least a little bit of plastic floating around in their stomachs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is a ton of information out there surrounding the implications of such widespread use (and the disposal) of plastics, a large majority of it still ends up in landfills. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are those who strive to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and they go about doing so in some pretty creative ways. Some use discarded plastics to build artful sculptures in hopes of promoting awareness of the issue. Others are repurposing the plastic to be used in the construction of eco-friendly homes, like the people of Nigeria.</span>\n\n![Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2GN_Z6VHYwE/VjzmkpB16FI/AAAAAAAAO9Y/Mkfy5eJ6ZFM/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg \"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\")\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nigeria currently suffers from a very intense housing crisis. It’s become so bad that **[Nigeria needs to build almost 16 million new housing units](http://phys.org/)** to accommodate the population. And because traditional homes are so expensive to build, they had to come up with an alternative solution.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two NGOs suggested they build homes from plastic bottles, locals have adopted the idea and started working toward solving the housing crisis.</span>\n\n![Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VyV5NSk3jkg/Vjzo9t9_-8I/AAAAAAAAO9w/44Qvi9OUba8/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg \"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\")\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaduna-based NGO Development Association for Renewable Energies (DARE) and London-based NGO Africa Community Trust, put together this project that is designed to knock out two birds with one stone. Not only are they working to eradicate the homeless problem, but the use of plastic bottles in homes will help keep plastic out of landfills.</span>\n\n![Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPG7kenbbZg/VjznHiiw2RI/AAAAAAAAO9g/Eh9REzuRMtc/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg \"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\")\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part? Not only will the homes produce zero carbon emissions, they are powered entirely by solar energy, and recycled methane gas from human and animal waste. Not to mention, because they’re built using mud, cement, and plastic bottles filled with sand, the structures are more solid than cinder blocks, are completely fireproof and bulletproof, and hold up quite well against earthquakes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tallest these structures can be built is three stories, because of weight. But, the various different plastics used to create the homes allow for some of the most unique patterns and colors you’ve ever seen in a home’s design.</span>\n\n![Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v2Z_zdezV3s/Vjzn0CfnFvI/AAAAAAAAO9o/QbtYYsKZCcE/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg \"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\")\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each home uses about 14,000 plastic bottles to complete. For perspective, Nigeria discards about three million bottles </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every day</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And the United States dwarfs this number by discarding almost 130 million bottles every day. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we repurposed these bottles, as Nigeria is currently doing, we could build around 9,200 homes per day, a number that would certainly put a dent in the 3.5 million homeless people currently living in the United States.</span>\n\n![Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DmTFe2t0Mo4/VjzpYl2VZ5I/AAAAAAAAO94/A9UUiKn7Bbs/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg \"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\")\n\n![Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0H0U0Pd4Kfw/VjzqyLbjkmI/AAAAAAAAO-A/pZMOAJ3QTBU/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg \"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\")\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

In fact, researchers estimate that by 2050, almost 100 percent of birds on the planet will have at least a little bit of plastic floating around in their stomachs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is a ton of information out there surrounding the implications of such widespread use (and the disposal) of plastics, a large majority of it still ends up in landfills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are those who strive to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and they go about doing so in some pretty creative ways. Some use discarded plastics to build artful sculptures in hopes of promoting awareness of the issue. Others are repurposing the plastic to be used in the construction of eco-friendly homes, like the people of Nigeria.</span></p>\n<p><img title=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2GN_Z6VHYwE/VjzmkpB16FI/AAAAAAAAO9Y/Mkfy5eJ6ZFM/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nigeria currently suffers from a very intense housing crisis. It’s become so bad that <strong><a href=\"http://phys.org/\">Nigeria needs to build almost 16 million new housing units</a></strong> to accommodate the population. And because traditional homes are so expensive to build, they had to come up with an alternative solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two NGOs suggested they build homes from plastic bottles, locals have adopted the idea and started working toward solving the housing crisis.</span></p>\n<p><img title=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VyV5NSk3jkg/Vjzo9t9_-8I/AAAAAAAAO9w/44Qvi9OUba8/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaduna-based NGO Development Association for Renewable Energies (DARE) and London-based NGO Africa Community Trust, put together this project that is designed to knock out two birds with one stone. Not only are they working to eradicate the homeless problem, but the use of plastic bottles in homes will help keep plastic out of landfills.</span></p>\n<p><img title=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPG7kenbbZg/VjznHiiw2RI/AAAAAAAAO9g/Eh9REzuRMtc/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part? Not only will the homes produce zero carbon emissions, they are powered entirely by solar energy, and recycled methane gas from human and animal waste. Not to mention, because they’re built using mud, cement, and plastic bottles filled with sand, the structures are more solid than cinder blocks, are completely fireproof and bulletproof, and hold up quite well against earthquakes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tallest these structures can be built is three stories, because of weight. But, the various different plastics used to create the homes allow for some of the most unique patterns and colors you’ve ever seen in a home’s design.</span></p>\n<p><img title=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v2Z_zdezV3s/Vjzn0CfnFvI/AAAAAAAAO9o/QbtYYsKZCcE/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each home uses about 14,000 plastic bottles to complete.

And the United States dwarfs this number by discarding almost 130 million bottles every day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we repurposed these bottles, as Nigeria is currently doing, we could build around 9,200 homes per day, a number that would certainly put a dent in the 3.5 million homeless people currently living in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><img title=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DmTFe2t0Mo4/VjzpYl2VZ5I/AAAAAAAAO94/A9UUiKn7Bbs/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0H0U0Pd4Kfw/VjzqyLbjkmI/AAAAAAAAO-A/pZMOAJ3QTBU/s1600/Nigerians%2BAre%2BBuilding%2BFireproof%252C%2BBulletproof%252C%2BAnd%2BEco-Friendly%2BHomes%2BWith%2BPlastic%2BBottles%2BAnd%2BMud.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud\" width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

                "slug": "15-superpowers-introverts-extroverts",
                "markdown": "\n**“I’m very picky with whom I give my energy to. I prefer to reserve my time, intensity and spirit exclusively to those who reflect sincerity.” – Dau Voire**\n\nIn our society where the extrovert is constantly celebrated and the introvert often ignored, we don’t spend enough time reflecting on the benefits that a diversity of personalities can bring to the table.\n\n*To celebrate the importance of introverts I wanted to share 20 strengths that they have over extroverts!*\n\n \n\n1. ** They are able to develop deeper focus.** Because they spend more time on quiet activities, introverts are able to concentrate more easily. This is a skill that they have typically learned over years of unintentional brain training.\n\n1. ** They have stronger personal boundaries.** When you live outside the confines of the group, you don’t feel the need to adjust your feelings to suit everyone else. As a result, introverts are more upfront about what they want from a situation, which sets boundaries and actually prevents feelings from getting hurt in the long run.\n\n1. ** Introverts don’t get bored.** Because they are stimulated by their internal worlds, they don’t constantly feel the need to seek entertainment from the outside and don’t get bored as easily their extroverted counterparts.\n\n1. **They are easier to get along with.** Extroverts sometimes clash when there’s more than one loud person in the room, introverts on the other hand will happily take a backseat, or just avoid situations whereby there may be a lot of chest pounding or egotism.\n\n1. ** Introverts have a lowered chance of obesity.** A **[study](http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/research/extraverted-children-are-more-biased-bowl-sizes-introverts)** by Cornell Food and Brand Lab found that extroverts are more likely to take larger food portions, which in the long term can lead to obesity.\n\n1. ** They understand themselves better.** Spending more time alone allows you time to reflect and learn to better understand yourself.\n\n**“Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well-ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” – Seneca**\n\n1. ** They learn from their mistakes.** Internal homework allows introverts to spend time reflecting on why things happen and make a real effort to improve them. This skill means that they are therefore much more likely to correct errors they make.\n\n1. ** Introverts are less impulsive.** Extroversion has been linked with behavioral impulsivity in a **[number of studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886997800104)**. Introverts, on the other hand, think their actions through and generally make better thought out decisions.\n\n1. ** They are more creative.** Because introverts tend to focus more intensely on things, including ideas and preferences, they develop a more obsessive and longer-term relationships with their hobbies, which often results in greater creativity. Consider Steve Jobs passion for Apple Computers or Albert Einstein’s fascination with physics.\n\n1. ** They’re better at reading emotions.** Because introverts spend more time listening, they can sometimes have a greater ability to read the emotions of those who they are talking to.\n\n1. ** They are more loyal.** When it comes to personal relationships, introverts value quality over quantity. This means that those friendships that do develop are often stronger and more highly valued than the more fluid and dynamic social world of the extrovert.\n\n1. ** They can be more effective leaders.** Though there is a stereotype of a leader as a loud extrovert, this isn’t necessarily the case. When in leadership roles, introverts have been found to celebrate the diversity and creativity of their staff, whereas extroverts tend to want to put their own stamp on things.\n2. ** Introverts are less emotionally reactive.** This is related to the impulsivity.

                "html": "<p><strong>“I’m very picky with whom I give my energy to. I prefer to reserve my time, intensity and spirit exclusively to those who reflect sincerity.” – Dau Voire</strong></p>\n<p>In our society where the extrovert is constantly celebrated and the introvert often ignored, we don’t spend enough time reflecting on the benefits that a diversity of personalities can bring to the table.</p>\n<p><em>To celebrate the importance of introverts I wanted to share 20 strengths that they have over extroverts!</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> They are able to develop deeper focus.</strong> Because they spend more time on quiet activities, introverts are able to concentrate more easily. This is a skill that they have typically learned over years of unintentional brain training.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> They have stronger personal boundaries.</strong> When you live outside the confines of the group, you don’t feel the need to adjust your feelings to suit everyone else. As a result, introverts are more upfront about what they want from a situation, which sets boundaries and actually prevents feelings from getting hurt in the long run.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Introverts don’t get bored.</strong> Because they are stimulated by their internal worlds, they don’t constantly feel the need to seek entertainment from the outside and don’t get bored as easily their extroverted counterparts.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>They are easier to get along with.</strong> Extroverts sometimes clash when there’s more than one loud person in the room, introverts on the other hand will happily take a backseat, or just avoid situations whereby there may be a lot of chest pounding or egotism.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Introverts have a lowered chance of obesity.</strong> A <strong><a href=\"http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/research/extraverted-children-are-more-biased-bowl-sizes-introverts\">study</a></strong> by Cornell Food and Brand Lab found that extroverts are more likely to take larger food portions, which in the long term can lead to obesity.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> They understand themselves better.</strong> Spending more time alone allows you time to reflect and learn to better understand yourself.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>“Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well-ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” &#8211; Seneca</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> They learn from their mistakes.</strong> Internal homework allows introverts to spend time reflecting on why things happen and make a real effort to improve them. This skill means that they are therefore much more likely to correct errors they make.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> Introverts are less impulsive.</strong> Extroversion has been linked with behavioral impulsivity in a <strong><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886997800104\">number of studies</a></strong>. Introverts, on the other hand, think their actions through and generally make better thought out decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong> They are more creative.</strong> Because introverts tend to focus more intensely on things, including ideas and preferences, they develop a more obsessive and longer-term relationships with their hobbies, which often results in greater creativity. Consider Steve Jobs passion for Apple Computers or Albert Einstein’s fascination with physics.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong> They’re better at reading emotions.</strong> Because introverts spend more time listening, they can sometimes have a greater ability to read the emotions of those who they are talking to.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><strong> They are more loyal.</strong> When it comes to personal relationships, introverts value quality over quantity. This means that those friendships that do develop are often stronger and more highly valued than the more fluid and dynamic social world of the extrovert.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li><strong> They can be more effective leaders.</strong> Though there is a stereotype of a leader as a loud extrovert, this isn’t necessarily the case. When in leadership roles, introverts have been found to celebrate the diversity and creativity of their staff, whereas extroverts tend to want to put their own stamp on things.</li>\n<li><strong> Introverts are less emotionally reactive.</strong> This is related to the impulsivity. Because they take the time to reflect, introverts are not emotionally reactive in the moments, like we often see with the louder people in a room.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li><strong> Introverts leave bigger legacies.</strong> Though in the short term the extrovert may be more memorable, many introverts tend to plug away at their life’s passions in solitude and create a body of work that is more comprehensive than those who spend a lot of energy socializing. Examples of this include Elon Musk, Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Steven Spielberg, JK Rowling, and Michael Jordan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Are you an introvert?

                "markdown": "\n \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The battle between cats and dogs is an age-old war that has left many people picking sides. Cat people get stigmatized as somewhat introverted people who would rather be in their own company, while dog people are often viewed as the outgoing, popular ones.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s probably not safe to generalize like that, a new Facebook study has found the stereotype to be mostly true.

It’s the traditional practice of paying 10 percent of your income and gains to the church, and in return you better your chances of getting into paradise once you pass away.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, have you ever heard of **[reverse tithing](http://ilikegiving.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-i-like-my-dad)**? People who practice this donate 90 percent of their income and gains to the church, keeping only 10 percent for themselves.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Couple Julia Wise and Jeff Kaufman are one couple who have decided to take on a similar ideology when it comes to donating to charity. Between Jeff, the software engineer, and Julia, the social worker, the pair make a little under $245,000 annually (which notches them in the top 10 percent of American households).</span>\n\n![](https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_E1AGubvye@2x.png)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from taxes and savings, they manage to live on only $15,280 (6.25%) of their annual income. The rest of the money they earn, which is about $100,000 (and just under half of their total income) is given to charity. Starting in 2008, the couple has done this </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every year</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since.</span>\n\n**[A few reasons why?](http://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Drowning-Grappling-Impossible-Overpowering/dp/1594204330?tag=quartz07-20)**\n\n**Income Doesn’t Necessarily Equate to Happiness**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Beatles once said: “You can’t buy me love.” And the same goes for happiness. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**[Research studying the correlation between money and happiness](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/04/subjective-well-being-income/subjective-well-being-income.pdf)**has found, time and time again, that increases in income do not increase a person’s happiness **[after reaching a certain amount](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~aronatas/Kahneman%20et%20al%20Would%20You%20Be%20Happier%20Science-2006.pdf)**.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked to rate their [life satisfaction](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2009/aknin2009a.pdf) on a scale of 1 to 10, US citizens making $32,000 a year rated their lives a 7 out of 10. However, those making $64,000 a year, which is </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the other people’s income, only rated their life satisfaction as 7.5 out of 10. A half a point increase.</span>\n\n**Giving is good for you**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**[One study](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lara_Aknin/publication/5494996_Spending_money_on_others_promotes_happiness/links/0c960536bc4c368a69000000.pdf)** had participants each receive an envelope with a moderate amount of money in it. They were split up into two groups: one group was told to spend the money on themselves, and the other group was told to **[spend it on someone else](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-104-4-635.pdf)**. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Group 1 used the money to splurge on something they’d wanted to buy, or even to pay bills. Group 2 either bought gifts for others or donated to charities.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guess which group reported the greater levels of happiness?

Its location is specific. Incans built the city high in the Andes Mountains, where the energy levels are greatest. People visiting this area describe the experience as something not of this world.</span>\n\n![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T7aCdmFme3A/V6mjrWxtFrI/AAAAAAAAFvM/8I6KLMENHTwk4Z4WWhTg4UhCwQJp0wovQCLcB/s640/Machu%2BPicchu%2Bin%2BPeru.JPG)\n\n![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9lIFyPqLmO0/V6mj47LrLVI/AAAAAAAAFvU/17c_g5SbtJ8xeuav9EZCPBb70UQ2V4p0gCLcB/s640/Machu%2BPicchu%2Bin%2BPeru_00.JPG)\n\n**Socotra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often described as “the most alien place on Earth,” Socotra consists of four small island in the Indian Ocean, just off the Horn of Africa. The biggest island of the four makes up about 95 percent of the archipelago. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes this planet so alien? Its landscape features flora and fauna that look nothing like anything else on Earth. And that’s because about 30 percent of the plant life found on the islands doesn’t exist anywhere else on Earth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The energy found in this foreign-looking world is so strong that it has been said to connect humans to the rest of the cosmos.</span>\n\n![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y1EZw41P2ng/V6m4eAL43kI/AAAAAAAAFvo/QRt1eNU4hqcU-Wi8UOWRhbWYeFgUYycAgCLcB/s640/Socotra.JPG)\n\n![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BQQpv5Ek3C0/V6m4107j85I/AAAAAAAAFvs/X67FSYuijkwFxBxRKoQnbh-0aZmH8-pdwCLcB/s640/Socotra_01.JPG)\n\n![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CDZ0tOhx-nc/V6m5FMJcNWI/AAAAAAAAFvw/TXDR50-_VLo1XDnfBJMeJ5CiIWoFDR_QgCLcB/s640/Socotra_02.JPG)\n\n**Easter Island**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve most likely heard about Easter Island because of its notoriously large stone statues. The statues are shrouded in mystery, as scientists have no idea who made them or why. They’ve also found 53 stone houses without windows or doors. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is the “Navel of the World” that is most mysterious about Easter Island. The circular stone that holds this title is believed to possess secrets of the cosmos, as it collects spiritual energies from the Earth.</span>\n\n![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CTByhYW2EsA/V6m5ylGRK2I/AAAAAAAAFwE/jRVQa9ThvdgUSnjHERY1X9OSISkJEahWgCLcB/s640/The%2BEaster%2BIsland.JPG)\n\n**The Bosnian Pyramids**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radio-carbon dating places the Bosnian Pyramids thousands of years before the creation of the Egyptian pyramids. In fact, they appear to be about 13,000 years old. Researchers discovered that three rooms and a small blue lake exist underneath the pyramids. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lake was found to be completely sterile and clean, with a noticeable lack of bacteria, fungi, algae, or any microorganisms. Thus, it has been given the title of “living water,” because it is believed to purify the body. This suggests that the three rooms are “healing rooms.”</span>\n\n![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vvSo2oGxU9A/V6m7hss1hUI/AAAAAAAAFws/PrCdQjrtI1UiaCF-5l6KcfHN344BplRRgCLcB/s640/The%2BBosnian%2BPyramids.JPG)\n\n![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mNGKwGByKRg/V6m7sO2leNI/AAAAAAAAFww/Dv5Dlei-x_oPkYULM9FsfPc8qrpzqdtBACLcB/s640/The%2BBosnian%2BPyramids_00.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

The biggest island of the four makes up about 95 percent of the archipelago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes this planet so alien? Its landscape features flora and fauna that look nothing like anything else on Earth. And that’s because about 30 percent of the plant life found on the islands doesn’t exist anywhere else on Earth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The energy found in this foreign-looking world is so strong that it has been said to connect humans to the rest of the cosmos.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y1EZw41P2ng/V6m4eAL43kI/AAAAAAAAFvo/QRt1eNU4hqcU-Wi8UOWRhbWYeFgUYycAgCLcB/s640/Socotra.JPG\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BQQpv5Ek3C0/V6m4107j85I/AAAAAAAAFvs/X67FSYuijkwFxBxRKoQnbh-0aZmH8-pdwCLcB/s640/Socotra_01.JPG\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CDZ0tOhx-nc/V6m5FMJcNWI/AAAAAAAAFvw/TXDR50-_VLo1XDnfBJMeJ5CiIWoFDR_QgCLcB/s640/Socotra_02.JPG\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><b>Easter Island</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve most likely heard about Easter Island because of its notoriously large stone statues. The statues are shrouded in mystery, as scientists have no idea who made them or why. They’ve also found 53 stone houses without windows or doors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is the “Navel of the World” that is most mysterious about Easter Island.

Researchers discovered that three rooms and a small blue lake exist underneath the pyramids. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lake was found to be completely sterile and clean, with a noticeable lack of bacteria, fungi, algae, or any microorganisms. Thus, it has been given the title of “living water,” because it is believed to purify the body. This suggests that the three rooms are “healing rooms.”</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"shareaholic-media-target-hover-state\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vvSo2oGxU9A/V6m7hss1hUI/AAAAAAAAFws/PrCdQjrtI1UiaCF-5l6KcfHN344BplRRgCLcB/s640/The%2BBosnian%2BPyramids.JPG\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mNGKwGByKRg/V6m7sO2leNI/AAAAAAAAFww/Dv5Dlei-x_oPkYULM9FsfPc8qrpzqdtBACLcB/s640/The%2BBosnian%2BPyramids_00.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"344\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

And apparently**[ the rest of the country has the same tendency](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/menu-innovations/kick-it-notch)**. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Flavor Trend found in a 2013 report that about 54 percent of Americans prefer hot or spicy foods, which includes different condiments, sauces and dips, as well.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This number has risen steadily over the years: only 48 percent enjoyed spicy foods in 2011, and 46 percent two years prior to that.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These numbers might not mean much by themselves, but a new study out of China has discovered that spicy foods might actually increase our life expectancy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The survey researchers studied had data from over 500,000 Chinese citizens which had been collected from 2004 to 2008. The survey featured questions about their diets; it also prompted people to note how much chili they consumed per week. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking back in with their participants seven years later, researchers discovered that people who ate spicy foods at least once a week were 10 percent less likely to die. That number rose to 14 percent if the individual ate spicy foods at least three to seven times each week.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know something about the beneficial effects of spicy foods basically from animal studies and very small-sized human studies,” associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, Lu Qi, told </span>**[*Time*](http://time.com/3984274/spicy-food-chili-peppers/).**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Past research has found that **[capsaicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin)**, the active component in most spicy dishes, has ties to decreased risks of cancer and heart and respiratory diseases. Other benefits include positive effects on the metabolism, on one’s weight and on the bacteria in our stomachs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It appears that increasing your intake moderately, just to one to two or three to five times a week, shows a very similar protective effect,” Qi said. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just increase moderately. That’s maybe enough.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it might be beneficial to keep a bottle of Tabasco or Cholula handy at all times, just to give your food that extra spicy, healthy kick that it needs. As long as you’re not downing a bottle each night, it might just help you live longer.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

That number rose to 14 percent if the individual ate spicy foods at least three to seven times each week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know something about the beneficial effects of spicy foods basically from animal studies and very small-sized human studies,” associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, Lu Qi, told </span><strong><a href=\"http://time.com/3984274/spicy-food-chili-peppers/\"><i>Time</i></a>.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Past research has found that <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin\">capsaicin</a></strong>, the active component in most spicy dishes, has ties to decreased risks of cancer and heart and respiratory diseases. Other benefits include positive effects on the metabolism, on one&#8217;s weight and on the bacteria in our stomachs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It appears that increasing your intake moderately, just to one to two or three to five times a week, shows a very similar protective effect,” Qi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just increase moderately. That’s maybe enough.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it might be beneficial to keep a bottle of Tabasco or Cholula handy at all times, just to give your food that extra spicy, healthy kick that it needs. As long as you’re not downing a bottle each night, it might just help you live longer.</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

Fantasy and nonsensical things happen regularly without question, but there is something to be taken away from certain things that you see.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re dreaming of certain objects or symbols, they could hold hidden meanings. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for these seven symbols when you find yourself in dreamland:</span>\n\n**Boxes**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you start seeing boxes in dreamworld, it’s a good sign that you feel something is being hidden from you. Empty boxes symbolize emotions of disappointment, and a large number of boxes can mean that you’re struggling with your emotions and want to stash them somewhere else.</span>\n\n**Phones**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there’s a phone ringing in your dream, it can mean that certain personality traits of yours are starting to come into alignment with your being. If a phone is ringing and you choose not to answer it, it can mean that you want to ignore any messages or insights that you are trying to send yourself.</span>\n\n**Flying**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself flying through the air in your dream, it’s a good sign that the dream has become lucid. Lucid dreams often happen when your subconscious is trying to reach you. Flying is symbolic of challenges or obstacles you’re working to overcome in real life.</span>\n\n**The Moon**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any dreams that have the moon in them can be indicative of a hidden creativity that is eager to be let out. </span>\n\n**Roads**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different types of roads can mean different things. Easy-going, paved, clean roads indicate that you feel the journey ahead of you will be relatively easy. But, if the road is dark, hard to see and you struggle navigating it, it can mean that you’re afraid of what’s to come.</span>\n\n**Flowers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flowers and plants can mean different things when you spot them in your dreams. If flowers are budding, it’s a sign that opportunity is just around the corner. If the flowers are dying or wilting, it can be a sign that this chapter of life is coming to an end. If you see little sproutlings, it can mean that any seeds you’ve planted are about to grow.</span>\n\n**Water**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water takes many forms, but they often reflect how ambitious you are in life. Dreams about the ocean can mean that you’re ready to take advantage of grand opportunities by taking a few risks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re dreaming of shallow bodies of water, it can mean that you’re focusing too much on something that is out of your reach at the moment.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

They’re usually blunt people that aren’t interested in any nonsense.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While every person’s definition of strong will vary, these are five signs that you’re a person with a strong or “intimidating” personality:</span>\n\n**You’re not a fan of small talk**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong personality types know that intelligent conversation isn’t something that everyone wants to partake in all the time, but it’s really the only kind of conversation they’re interested in (at least in social settings). They enjoy conversing with people who are curious about the world and want to discuss matters of substance.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, strong personality types get labeled as rude when they say this to a person’s face. At least they have the decency to be genuine.</span>\n\n**You dislike ignorant or intolerant people**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the most part, people with strong personality types enjoy being intellectual by nature. Their natural curiosity has lead them to seek out information regarding all walks of life, so they’re usually quite knowledgeable. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, they typically do not get along with people who speak before thinking or who generally have no idea what they’re talking about. Ignorance stems from having a closed mind, a notion that strong personality types want nothing to do with.</span>\n\n**Your hard work creates opportunity**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a strong personality type, you know that hard work is one of the best ways to open up doors for yourself. As if the harder you worked, the better your chances became. A determined work ethic is a tool that strong people use to manifest opportunity where there otherwise would be none.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re good at recognizing these created opportunities, and they’re going to use them to succeed, whether people are intimidated by their success or not.</span>\n\n**You don’t like being in the spotlight**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong personality types often carry with them behaviors, attitudes and mannerisms that most people admire. They naturally attract both good and bad people. But, at the end of the day, they’d honestly rather not have any of the attention.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also means that they’d rather put their head down and work than seek out any sort of attention. They’re only worried about finishing whatever needs to be finished.</span>\n\n**You hate when people complain or have excuses**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excuses and complaints are just wasted energy in the eyes of the strong-willed. Strong personality types have worked through undesirable circumstances before, so they know things don’t always go the way you want them to, and they expect others to know the same.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complaining doesn’t serve anyone any good. Instead, they’d rather figure out a solution to the problem so that they can keep moving forward.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong personalities don’t have time for anyone who’s not 100 percent invested.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

Everything that is going on in our lives exists because we believe in it. This includes the good, the bad and everything in-between.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Don’t believe you can lose weight? You won’t.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Don’t believe you can find a cure? You’ll be sick forever.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Don’t believe you can start your own business? You’ll work for someone else your whole life.</span>\n\n\n## Facts are an illusion\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Our belief structures are what define what is possible in our lives. There are no facts, there are no prerequisites. Your life is simply a reflection of what you choose to believe in and focus on, and nothing more.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So often, we drink the kool-aid,we buy into limitations and we take them as fact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We honestly believe that there aren’t answers to our problems. We sincerely feel as if the limitations we experience are a foregone conclusion.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For this reason, today, I ask you to think about something you’ve always wanted, but never even dared to dream for.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Think about something that could drastically improve your life, but you’ve never for a second even taken the chance to imagine you could really have it.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Take a moment to really ponder the statement “anything is possible,” and imagine that it really does apply to you and your life.</span>\n\n\n## What limiting beliefs have you been accepting as facts?\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Limitations can run deep, and even experienced practitioners of the Law of Attraction can still find they are able to unearth old limitations they’ve taken as fact.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, this week, I found a cure to a medical issue I’ve dealt with my* entire *adult life. It’s a rather embarrassing medical issue, so for now we’ll just call it a “medical issue.” I’ll see if I can work up the courage to be a little more open about it, as it’s a cure that might benefit some of my readers as well-who knows?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Anyway, I assumed I would be stuck with this issue forever, because I accepted it as a fact. I just accepted it as “the way things were.” I was taught at a young age that this was just something you’d have to live with forever, and I believed what I was told. I took this factor of my life as a foregone conclusion, just like we do factors of ourselves like our age, our gender and our eye color (which, by the way, are just other perceived limitations we accept as facts).</span>\n\n\n## Assumptions are dream killers\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I assumed my condition was due to my genetics, or something outside of my control. I assumed science didn’t have an answer, so every time I researched how to treat it I heard the same thing: “It never goes away.” </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As a result, I decided long ago that this condition was just something I’d have in my life forever.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Since it wasn’t a terminal illness, and I was able to still live a really good life in spite of it, I just figured I’d deal with it forever. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The solution is pretty freaking amazing, and it’s really blown my mind.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The only reason I didn’t find it before? I never thought to ask for it! I ASSUMED it was incurable, and therefore in my reality, it was.</span>\n\n\n## Dare to dream already!\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Fortunately, though, I decided enough was enough. I know in my heart anything is possible, after all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So I looked to the universe and said “I KNOW anything is possible, and I KNOW a cure can exist. Show it to me.”</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then, almost immediately, it came to me.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Reminding myself that I believed in possibility gave me the conviction to ask for something and believe that it could be out there.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, I invite you to join me. Dare to dream, and dare to ask.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The universe is capable of delivering you anything, you just have to be willing to believe it is possible for you.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Keep dreaming my friends!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span>\n\n*(Law of Attraction coach & educator)*\n\n### Are you a student of the Law of Attraction?\n\nSign up for my free [Law of Attraction newsletter](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&id=db39a47128 \"subscribe\") for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.  You can also become a member of my LOA member website and gain access to a library of video tutorials, ebooks, audiobooks and meditations.  Learn how to attract the things you want with fun, clarity and success!   Join today for as little as[ $1.99](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=1 \"become a member for just $1.99!\") or become an annual member for [30% in savings](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=2 \"annual member\").\n\n*Article Source: This article was originally published at [Raise Your Vibration Today](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/04/anything-is-possible-impossible/) and has been reposted with permission from the author.*\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

It happens to most of us at some point, so you aren’t alone!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To understand if you are ego-driven, it can help to understand what your ego is. The ego isn’t who you are, but rather it is just a fragment of your consciousness.</span>\n\n\n## What is the ego?\n\n<span class=\"s1\">See, there are several aspects that make up who you are as a conscious being.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>One, is the loving light that makes up your soul. This is the part of you that is strongly connected to the divine (and therefore connected to every other being as well).</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The other, is your ego, or the mask you wear that tells you that you are different from others.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Your ego is your self-image in this physical reality. Because the ego observes your separation from others, it is often the part of you that seeks to protect you from others, rather than connect you with them.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The ego isn’t a “bad” thing, and it isn’t something you should try to get rid of. In fact, your ego does serve a very powerful purpose. It allows you to perceive the world from a unique, differentiated perspective. Without the ego, it would probably be pretty hard to root down into this physical world, and have this experience as a separate, human consciousness.</span>\n\n\n## When an ego is out of control.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">With that being said, sometimes the ego does a lot more of the driving in life than is useful. An ego-driven person frequently pushes down the higher, loving aspect of him or herself and allows the ego to take primary control.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The ego-driven person usually measures his or herself from a competitive viewpoint.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>For this reason, ego-driven people are often in hot pursuit of being ” “stronger than,” “smarter than,” “richer than” or some other element of “better than” other people. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is born out of the desire to protect the self, but left unchecked the ego-self can become a tyrant. An out-of-control ego forgets entirely about the importance of unity, love and our ability to connect with others in meaningful and fulfilling ways.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To the ego mind, there is no connection. There are only winners and losers, and the ego desperately wants to win.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “[7 Signs of An Out of Control Ego](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/03/03/7-signs-of-an-out-of-control-ego/ \"signs of an out of control ego\")“*\n\n\n## How to check your ego when it’s out of control.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, what do you do when you feel your competitive ego taking more control over your life than you’d like? How do you check your ego, and allow more of your love and kindness to shine through?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here are 9 easy ways to check your ego. Next time you find yourself caught up in the rat race of “winners and losers” try one of them out!</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">1. Remember, we’re not all perfect.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The ego is quick to point out other people’s mistakes and missteps. When you find yourself judging the actions of others, understand that is the ego at play. Step back into the loving aspect of yourself by remembering that you make mistakes too, and you appreciate it when people love you in spite of them.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">2. Remind yourself that people often act out when they are hurting.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There’s nothing more annoying to an ego-driven person than another ego-driven person! However, it’s possible to check your ego even in the presence of someone else who is fully ego-driven. Just remember that those who are ego-driven are often acting out of fear or pain. Their competitive natures are typically driven by the threats they perceive from the outside world. When people are hurting or scared, they often step into the ego-self for protection.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">3. List out the things that are most important to you in life.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Think about what you want to look back on when you are on your deathbed. The achievements and experiences you ultimately wish to have will likely resonate much more strongly with your higher self than with your ego.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">4. Practice gratitude for the things you already have.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The ego is more concerned with what he or she doesn’t have, as again, the ego is very worried about coming up short. Gratitude reminds you of all of the ways you are supported and abundant, and therefore have no reason to worry about losing.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">5. Think back on a time someone showed you they really loved you.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Looking back on loving memories is an excellent way to connect back into your higher self. Just thinking about being connected in love is often enough to tap you in to your higher knowing.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">6. Help someone less fortunate than yourself.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Helping those less fortunate than yourself reminds you that you really don’t like for people to lose in life. The loving aspect of yourself wants everyone to win. When one of us loses, we all lose!</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">7. Give someone a long hug.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The simple act of connecting with another person in a loving manner can help bring you back into resonance with the loving aspects of yourself.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">8. Meditate, to center back into the loving part of yourself.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The ego thrives on mental clutter and fearful, worrisome<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>thoughts. Clear out the mental clutter with meditation.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">9. Play devil’s advocate for the people you are arguing with or competing against.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Why might they be right? Why might it be good for them to “win” instead of you? Playing devil’s advocate allows you to connect with another person’s perspective, rather than separate from it.</span>\n\n\n## *Keep your perspective as high as possible, but respect your ego too!*\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remember, we all have an ego, and that’s ok. You aren’t supposed to be without an ego, and it does serve a very powerful and important purpose. Without an ego, it’s unlikely that we would have a separate sense of self in this human experience.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The ego makes the game of life a lot more exciting and interesting. An ego allows you view reality like a movie, with you getting to be one of the characters.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">With that being said, a life driven entirely by the ego can be a very sad and unfortunate one. Our ability to connect, to love, and to laugh together is what makes this human experience so wonderful and enjoyable. When we allow our egos to take control in life, we disconnect from the most satisfying elements of life. It’s like we forget it’s all just a movie, and we take things much more seriously than we need to.</span>\n\nA life driven entirely by the ego is one filled with pain, anger and frustration.\n\n\n## You are infinite and eternal, and everything is going to be ok.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Ultimately, we are connected to every being on the planet, and beyond. We are all connected to an infinite source consciousness. In fact we all ultimately ARE infinite source consciousness.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This means, in the end, there is nothing to fear, and nothing we need protection from. Everything that makes up this universe is us, and we it.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This reality is simply a platform we’ve created to play around in and experience. The threats our ego perceive exist only in the illusion that is this physical reality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>All of the struggle, and all of the pain is just a part of the ride. It isn’t anything we really need protection from, in the end, as it is [our own creation](http://www.raiseyourvibrationtoday.com \"Raise Your Vibration Today\").</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Again, it’s just like watching a movie. There’s a lot more going on when the show’s over! See yourself as a character in the movie, enjoying the ride, but keep that inner knowing that you are connected to something far greater than this individual life experience. </span>\n\nRemember, we’re all in this together. We are all one, therefore we are all actually safe as infinite, eternal beings. Your ego will try to get you to forget this, but your higher perspective knows this well.\n\nPut your ego in the passenger seat to enjoy the ride of life, but let your higher perspective do the driving. Everything is going to be just fine in the end.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span>\n\n*(Law of Attraction coach & educator)*\n\n### Are you a student of the Law of Attraction?\n\nSign up for my free [Law of Attraction newsletter](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&id=db39a47128 \"subscribe\") for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.  You can also become a member of my LOA member website and gain access to a library of video tutorials, ebooks, audiobooks and meditations.  Learn how to attract the things you want with fun, clarity and success!   Join today for as little as[ $1.99](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=1 \"become a member for just $1.99!\") or become an annual member for [30% in savings](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=2 \"annual member\").\n\n*Article Source: This article was originally published at [Raise Your Vibration Today](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/09/ways-to-check-your-ego-out-of-control/) and has been republished with permission from the artist.*\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

                "markdown": "\nBy [**Andrea Schulman**](https://www.facebook.com/raiseyourvibrationtoday/?fref=ts) | [**Raise Your Vibration Today **](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/10/reasons-to-always-embrace-change/)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Lost your job? Going through a breakup? Moving to a new place where you don’t know anyone?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Change can be pretty traumatic if you let it get to you! However, there are a lot of reasons to embrace change. Good or bad, pretty or ugly, change has the ability to enhance your life for the better when you choose to get on board with it.</span>\n\n\n## *<span class=\"s1\">Embrace change because…</span>*\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">1. Change is inevitable.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The only constant in life is change. You can embrace change, or you can fight it, but change WILL happen. Might as well go with the flow!</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">2. Change creates more excitement and adventure in your life.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Honestly, if life never changed you would be so bored! While stability is comfortable, too much stability feels stagnant. Change can give your life positive momentum.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">3. Change will reveal to you who’s really important in your life.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You’ll never be quite so inclined to know who’s really there for you when you move, get married, have a baby or lose a friend. Big changes have a way of revealing to you the people in your life who are your biggest positive influences (and not-so-positive influences!).</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">4. Change is an opportunity to become someone new, or try on a new identity. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When you suddenly find yourself single, in a new job or on another new path, suddenly you have the opportunity to try on a new role. Sometimes a new role comes with a new look, a new skill set and/or a new routine. It can be a lot of fun to become a new person.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">5. Change adds chapters to your life story.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The more change you experience in life, the more chapters you have to look back on. The more stories you have to tell your grandkids, and the more lessons you can share with the people you care about. A full life is one chock full of changing times, places, people and experiences.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">6. Change is the universe’s way of preparing you for something you’ve been wanting.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Sometimes, the quickest route to your dreams is taken by smashing through a brick wall. The universe has a way of shaking things up when we are ready to transition to the next level.

Going through a breakup? Moving to a new place where you don’t know anyone?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Change can be pretty traumatic if you let it get to you! However, there are a lot of reasons to embrace change. Good or bad, pretty or ugly, change has the ability to enhance your life for the better when you choose to get on board with it.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Embrace change because…</span></em></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">1. Change is inevitable.</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The only constant in life is change. You can embrace change, or you can fight it, but change WILL happen. Might as well go with the flow!</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">2. Change creates more excitement and adventure in your life.</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Honestly, if life never changed you would be so bored! While stability is comfortable, too much stability feels stagnant. Change can give your life positive momentum.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">3. Change will reveal to you who’s really important in your life.</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">You’ll never be quite so inclined to know who’s really there for you when you move, get married, have a baby or lose a friend. Big changes have a way of revealing to you the people in your life who are your biggest positive influences (and not-so-positive influences!).</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">4. Change is an opportunity to become someone new, or try on a new identity. </span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">When you suddenly find yourself single, in a new job or on another new path, suddenly you have the opportunity to try on a new role. Sometimes a new role comes with a new look, a new skill set and/or a new routine. It can be a lot of fun to become a new person.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">5. Change adds chapters to your life story.</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The more change you experience in life, the more chapters you have to look back on. The more stories you have to tell your grandkids, and the more lessons you can share with the people you care about. A full life is one chock full of changing times, places, people and experiences.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">6. Change is the universe’s way of preparing you for something you’ve been wanting.</span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes, the quickest route to your dreams is taken by smashing through a brick wall. The universe has a way of shaking things up when we are ready to transition to the next level. Embracing the change ensures you receive the positive benefits on the other side of it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If life is changing quickly for you right now, strap on your seatbelt, hold on to your hat, and do your best to embrace the transition you are experiencing. There will be good things that result from this change, and the more you can go with the flow, the quicker you’ll reap the benefit of this shift.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>(Law of Attraction coach &amp; educator)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Are you a student of the Law of Attraction?</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sign up for my free <a title=\"subscribe\" href=\"http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&amp;id=db39a47128\" target=\"_blank\">Law of Attraction newsletter</a> for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.  You can also become a member of my LOA member website and gain access to a library of video tutorials, ebooks, audiobooks and meditations.  Learn how to attract the things you want with fun, clarity and success!   Join today for as little as<a title=\"become a member for just $1.99!\" href=\"https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=1\" target=\"_blank\"> $1.99</a> or become an annual member for <a title=\"annual member\" href=\"https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=2\" target=\"_blank\">30% in savings</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Article Source: This article was originally published at <a href=\"http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/10/reasons-to-always-embrace-change/\">Raise Your Vibration Today</a> and has been republished with the author&#8217;s permission.</em></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

When the crow is reaching out to us, we may experience sudden visions of who we are meant to be on the truest level. The crow sees our soul for exactly what it is. It knows what we’re capable of doing, and will remind us of our potential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that same capacity, the crow will encourage you to step outside of your comfort zone so that you can discover all that lies ahead of you. So don&#8217;t be afraid to chase after opportunity or success.</span></p>\n<p><b>Magic, and the ability to </b><b><i>see</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <strong><a href=\"http://www.shamanicjourney.com/crow-power-animal-symbol-of-sacred-law-change\">blackness of the crow</a> </strong>is highly symbolic of the night, and the darkness from which all life is and creation is wrought. It is also a reminder that you carry with you this power to create the destiny (or life) that you want for yourself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The appearance of a crow can also be a sign that you are gifted with clairvoyance, an extrasensory perception that lets you peer into the realm of spirits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, next time you see a crow, watch it, listen to it, observe its being. It is probably a sign. It is there to help you move forward in life, whatever that looks like for you. If you’re in the midst of a change, you will persevere, as long as you remain true to yourself.</span></p>\n<p>h/t <a href=\"http://www.collective-evolution.com/2016/04/24/have-you-been-seeing-crows-what-the-crow-symbolizes-more-than-just-death/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Collective Evolution</strong></a></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

While some see numbers as completely arbitrary symbols that only represent certain number values, others know that each one is connected to the universe in its own unique way.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numbers are inherent within all of nature. So, it would be in your best interest to learn a bit about what each number means and how you might be able to apply it to your life at the moment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a short guide to understanding the meaning of different numbers:</span>\n\n**Number: One**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number one is closely tied to strong wills, positivity, and raw energy. If you’re seeing the number one all over the place throughout your days, it can mean that you are destined to start a new chapter of your life soon. This is the time to start something new, and the number one is telling us to do so.</span>\n\n**Number: Two**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two symbolizes kindness, balance, and duality. If you’re seeing a lot of two’s lately, the number is calling on you to make a decision about something. It’s telling you to ditch indecision and side with whichever choice most closely aligns with your being.</span>\n\n**Number: Three**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three is often related with magic, intuition, and opportunity, as it’s also closely tied to time: the past, present, and future. If three’s are plentiful in your life, you are being called on to express any creativity you’ve been holding back, or to think about the direction your life is going. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can also mean that you may soon be rewarded or successful in life.</span>\n\n**Number: Four**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number four is largely symbolic of stability and being grounded. It’s a nice square number, one that is found in many areas of life. We have four seasons, four main directions on a compass, and four main elements (water, wind, fire, earth), just to name a few. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re seeing four’s, think about making a change in the direction of your origins, your roots. You need to get back to solid ground.</span>\n\n**Number: Five**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Movement, adventure, and travel are all symbolized by the number five. It is also highly influential in change. If a large number of fives start appearing in your life, prepare yourself for change, chaos, or adventure (or maybe all three). </span>\n\n**Number: Six**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six is one of the most powerful numbers in the universe. It symbolizes harmony, love, balance and truth. Six is the number we call upon when we seek guidance in the handling of sensitive issues. It is the light that provides balance to our spirits and our minds.</span>\n\n**Number: Seven**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seven is a number that is associated with magic, just like the number three. However, seven largely deals with how we perceive and create the reality we live in by actively trying to manifest that reality through heightened consciousness and awareness. Which means it’s also closely tied to illusions of grandeur.</span>\n\n**Number: Eight**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number eight symbolizes wealth, success and business, and this is because of eight’s cyclical nature: it’s like an infinity sign. You will see eights where success can only be achieved through a dedicated work ethic. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number eight symbolizes momentum: once you pick up speed, you only increase from there.</span>\n\n**Number: Nine**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the apex of vibrations, the number nine represents satisfaction, accomplishment, and the ability to influence. Nine is inherent in intellect, creativity, and one’s influence over their current circumstances. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nine wants us to understand our abilities and how they can fit in with the rest of the world to make lasting, positive change.</span>\n\n \n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

It is the light that provides balance to our spirits and our minds.</span></p>\n<p><b>Number: Seven</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seven is a number that is associated with magic, just like the number three. However, seven largely deals with how we perceive and create the reality we live in by actively trying to manifest that reality through heightened consciousness and awareness. Which means it’s also closely tied to illusions of grandeur.</span></p>\n<p><b>Number: Eight</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number eight symbolizes wealth, success and business, and this is because of eight’s cyclical nature: it’s like an infinity sign. You will see eights where success can only be achieved through a dedicated work ethic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number eight symbolizes momentum: once you pick up speed, you only increase from there.</span></p>\n<p><b>Number: Nine</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the apex of vibrations, the number nine represents satisfaction, accomplishment, and the ability to influence. Nine is inherent in intellect, creativity, and one’s influence over their current circumstances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nine wants us to understand our abilities and how they can fit in with the rest of the world to make lasting, positive change.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

Cola was 9 months old when the neighbor cut off both of his front legs using a sword.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Cola’s spirits are definitely not down, as you can tell. His miraculous recovery from the terrible incident that happened last year is thanks to the collective support and donations from people around the world like yourself.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cola received special care from a clinic in Bangkok.

They might even slow down the aging process!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few great benefits that burning bay leaves in your home can provide:</span>\n\n**They relieve anxiety, tension and fatigue**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Containing compounds like cineol, pinene, and elemicin, bay leaves fill the air with a relaxed energy. They’ve even been said to produce psychedelic-like effects. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do this, take your dry bay leaf and light one if its ends on fire. Blow out the fire so that the leaf is still burning, but slowly. Then, set it on a fireproof tray or dish, and let the smoke fill your space (similar to incense).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After burning the bay leaf, you should notice yourself experiencing feelings of relaxation and easiness. Your mind gains clarity, alertness and energy as your stress melts away.</span>\n\n**It clears out the respiratory system**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lesser known benefit of bay leaves are their ability to open up any clogged airways, including in our lungs. It naturally breaks down and gets rid of mucus and phlegm that builds up in our system. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve these effects, do not burn the bay leaf. Instead, soak fresh bay leaves in water, or obtain bay leaf oil, and put it in a humidifier to fill the air with a bay leaf vapor that is safe to breathe in. </span>\n\n**It helps fortify cardiovascular health**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chock-full of caffeic acid, bay leaves promote healthy capillary walls in the heart.

They might even slow down the aging process!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few great benefits that burning bay leaves in your home can provide:</span></p>\n<p><b>They relieve anxiety, tension and fatigue</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Containing compounds like cineol, pinene, and elemicin, bay leaves fill the air with a relaxed energy. They’ve even been said to produce psychedelic-like effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do this, take your dry bay leaf and light one if its ends on fire. Blow out the fire so that the leaf is still burning, but slowly. Then, set it on a fireproof tray or dish, and let the smoke fill your space (similar to incense).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After burning the bay leaf, you should notice yourself experiencing feelings of relaxation and easiness. Your mind gains clarity, alertness and energy as your stress melts away.</span></p>\n<p><b>It clears out the respiratory system</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lesser known benefit of bay leaves are their ability to open up any clogged airways, including in our lungs. It naturally breaks down and gets rid of mucus and phlegm that builds up in our system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve these effects, do not burn the bay leaf. Instead, soak fresh bay leaves in water, or obtain bay leaf oil, and put it in a humidifier to fill the air with a bay leaf vapor that is safe to breathe in. </span></p>\n<p><b>It helps fortify cardiovascular health</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chock-full of caffeic acid, bay leaves promote healthy capillary walls in the heart. Not to mention, caffeic acid also helps rid your body of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), the “bad” kind of cholesterol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to gain these benefits is by using the bay leaf in your cooking.

That’s about as long as it takes to walk the trash out to the trash can or microwave some leftovers. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How’d they do it? Researchers [studied nine men](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0154075.PDF) who lead predominantly sedentary lifestyles by having them do an entire minute of high-intensity cycling at least three times a week for 12 weeks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The minute of high-intensity cycling was broken down into three 20-second intervals where each subject was to put forth their maximum effort for the whole 20 seconds. Then, they did a two-minute recovery period with only moderate-intensity cycling in between each 20-second burst.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A second group of 10 men were tasked with performing what you’d consider an average workout regimen, consisting of 45-minute sessions of non-stop, moderate-intensity cycling at least three times a week. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a control group, researchers had six men do absolutely no exercising over the course of 12 weeks.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What they found after the 12 weeks were up was quite interesting. The high-intensity, short-interval group had made similar gains to the normal, moderate-intensity group.

That’s about as long as it takes to walk the trash out to the trash can or microwave some leftovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How’d they do it? Researchers <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0154075.PDF\">studied nine men</a> who lead predominantly sedentary lifestyles by having them do an entire minute of high-intensity cycling at least three times a week for 12 weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The minute of high-intensity cycling was broken down into three 20-second intervals where each subject was to put forth their maximum effort for the whole 20 seconds. Then, they did a two-minute recovery period with only moderate-intensity cycling in between each 20-second burst.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A second group of 10 men were tasked with performing what you’d consider an average workout regimen, consisting of 45-minute sessions of non-stop, moderate-intensity cycling at least three times a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a control group, researchers had six men do absolutely no exercising over the course of 12 weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What they found after the 12 weeks were up was quite interesting. The high-intensity, short-interval group had made similar gains to the normal, moderate-intensity group. Both showed improved blood sugar levels, endurance and muscle function when compared to the control group that did not exercise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0154075.PDF\">This study</a> is a relatively extreme example that shows the effectiveness of brief, very intense bursts of exercise,&#8221; said Martin J.

                "markdown": "\n \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever wonder what your life would be like if you suddenly dropped some of the habits that you do regularly? As a person who drinks coffee pretty much every morning, the notion can be a tough one to stomach. Maybe even more so for the person who enjoys having a few beers every night after work or on the weekends when it’s play time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a lot can change in your life by cutting out certain habits. If you’ve been thinking about making a change, here’s one person’s account of the things that changed for them after ditching coffee and alcohol completely:</span>\n\n**You’ll save quite a bit of money**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever thought about how pricey alcoholic beverages can be? I mean, I had two tacos and a beer tonight for dinner; the beer cost me $3.50 and the tacos cost me $8. I can buy a whole six-pack of beer for $9.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you regularly go out and spend money on drinks, whether it’s at a bar or a restaurant, you’re likely paying quite a bit to consume that alcohol. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cocktails easily reach up to $10 a piece, with beers ranging around $4 to $5 each. Even if you you spend only $10 a day on alcohol, that’s $300 a month. Not to mention, people rarely just drink. They get food and appetizers to go with it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you know it, all of these things add up, and you’re spending thousands of dollars.</span>\n\n**Less social drama**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not drinking as often, you’re probably not going out as often. Cutting alcohol out of your diet means quite a few things in the social world. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One, you’re going to have to explain to people why you’re not drinking and that not even having one drink is okay with you. Two, you probably won’t want to go out as much, and you’ll want to hear about social gossip even less. Three, you’re not going to want to hang out with a bunch of drunk people while you’re sober for very long. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you’ll quickly realize how many of your friendships were based entirely on your shared passion for getting drunk.</span>\n\n**You’ll sleep better**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality of sleep is a very real thing, and it’s not just about how fast you can fall asleep. Sure, having a glass of wine or two will help you doze off into la-la land fairly fast, but how well are you sleeping once you doze off? And how well do you feel in the mornings?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting alcohol makes waking up easier and gives you more energy during your days.</span>\n\n**Less coffee, less anxiety**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this point should be taken on a case-by-case basis, coffee is not for everyone. I used to never drink coffee and I was fine. I drink coffee now, and I’m fine. But for a lot of people the caffeine can lead to increased bouts of anxiety and difficulty with digestion.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve been thinking about ditching coffee, do it. If you love the taste and smell, grab your favorite decaf and snack on that when you get a craving. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, coffee is a social activity, just like alcohol. Make sure you’re not just drinking stuff so you can hang out with your friends. </span>\n\nh/t [**HuffingtonPost**](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobias-van-schneider/no-alcohol-no-coffee-for-15-months-this-is-what-happened_b_8723958.html)\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

I can buy a whole six-pack of beer for $9.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you regularly go out and spend money on drinks, whether it’s at a bar or a restaurant, you’re likely paying quite a bit to consume that alcohol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cocktails easily reach up to $10 a piece, with beers ranging around $4 to $5 each. Even if you you spend only $10 a day on alcohol, that’s $300 a month. Not to mention, people rarely just drink. They get food and appetizers to go with it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you know it, all of these things add up, and you&#8217;re spending thousands of dollars.</span></p>\n<p><b>Less social drama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not drinking as often, you’re probably not going out as often. Cutting alcohol out of your diet means quite a few things in the social world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One, you’re going to have to explain to people why you’re not drinking and that not even having one drink is okay with you. Two, you probably won’t want to go out as much, and you’ll want to hear about social gossip even less. Three, you’re not going to want to hang out with a bunch of drunk people while you’re sober for very long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you’ll quickly realize how many of your friendships were based entirely on your shared passion for getting drunk.</span></p>\n<p><b>You’ll sleep better</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality of sleep is a very real thing, and it’s not just about how fast you can fall asleep. Sure, having a glass of wine or two will help you doze off into la-la land fairly fast, but how well are you sleeping once you doze off? And how well do you feel in the mornings?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quitting alcohol makes waking up easier and gives you more energy during your days.</span></p>\n<p><b>Less coffee, less anxiety</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this point should be taken on a case-by-case basis, coffee is not for everyone. I used to never drink coffee and I was fine. I drink coffee now, and I’m fine. But for a lot of people the caffeine can lead to increased bouts of anxiety and difficulty with digestion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve been thinking about ditching coffee, do it. If you love the taste and smell, grab your favorite decaf and snack on that when you get a craving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, coffee is a social activity, just like alcohol. Make sure you’re not just drinking stuff so you can hang out with your friends. </span></p>\n<p>h/t <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobias-van-schneider/no-alcohol-no-coffee-for-15-months-this-is-what-happened_b_8723958.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HuffingtonPost</strong></a></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

So if you are, trust you are in good company.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Now I’m not sure why so many students of the LOA are people pleasers, but I have my theories. I personally believe that people who are empathic and intuitive are often drawn to the LOA, and I think this has something to do with it.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Empathy and intuition often go hand-in-hand with people pleasing. After all, if you are highly sensitive, you can just “tell” when someone is upset or going through a challenging time. Naturally, you may want to help them feel better.</span><span class=\"s1\">  \n</span>\n\n\n## People pleasing causes more harm than good!\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, people pleasing really doesn’t help anyone at all in the long run. Of course, we may be able to avoid a fight or prevent someone we care about from being upset in the moment. However, this comes at a cost to our own feelings, emotions and self-esteem.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After all, if you live your life constantly adjusting how you act in order to serve others, this can cause you to feel extremely marginalized and overlooked. Your feelings and emotions are very important, after all!  When you push them down to for the sake of someone else, you set your self up for frustration, sadness or even anger down the road.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Beyond that, people pleasing prevents the other people in your life from handling their own emotions and problems. It keeps them from learning to deal with the reality that other people have feelings and needs too. In a nutshell, people pleasing prevents other people from their own growth, expansion and empowerment. </span>\n\n***Related Article: [Are You Energy Sensitive? 6 Telling Signs](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/10/20/are-you-energy-sensitive-signs/ \"Are You Energy Sensitive?\")***\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, what do you think: Are you a people pleaser? If so, how do you stop people pleasing? What are empathic or intuitive people to do when they are used to putting their own needs second (or third, or fourth, or seventy-fifth)?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I’ve got one easy trick to help you out. Here it is:</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">*Are You a People Pleaser? Easy Trick: *</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is a super, super easy trick you can use at any time to evaluate if your choices and behaviors are authentic to you, and to answer the question: Are you a people pleaser?</span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">**How it works:**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Often times, people pleasers are so used to putting their own wants and needs on the back burner that they totally forget how to act authentically around certain people! People pleasers condition themselves to always evaluate the other person first. For that reason, sometimes it’s hard to know for sure when you are people pleasing! </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So this trick is helpful, because it helps you know for sure when you are people pleasing.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When you aren’t sure if you are people pleasing or not, just ask yourself: “Would I do this if this person wasn’t here right now?” OR “Would I choose to do this if this person was someone else I really, truly trusted?” </span>\n\nMeasure your behaviors against what you would choose to do if you weren’t in the company of someone you might disappoint.\n\n### Quick example:\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, let’s say your mother has come to stay with you for the week at your house, and you worry that you often people please around her.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So while she’s at your house, evaluate your behaviors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>“Would I be running around cleaning up like this if she wasn’t here?” “Would I have agreed with her opinion if she was someone I really trusted?”</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you find that you are engaged in a behavior you wouldn’t do if your mother wasn’t around, you can bet your bottom dollar you are people pleasing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You are tiptoeing around her in order to avoid getting a negative reaction. </span>\n\n### <span class=\"s1\">*Ok, so I know I am people pleasing, but how do I stop?*</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You’ll find that when you use the trick above it’s pretty easy to tell if you are people pleasing. With that being said, how do you stop people pleasing?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After all, sometimes it’s hard to stop people pleasing. If you’re used to turning cartwheels to please someone, it’s probably an automatic behavior by now.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So here’s a quick suggestion, and it’s fairly simple:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Instead of trying to stop your people pleasing, try to start your **“me pleasing”** instead*.*</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, when you are around someone you usually people please, periodically ask yourself “what might I do right now that I enjoy when I’m by myself or with someone I really trust?” Then, pick a few behaviors or activities, and throw them into the mix! </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The more you choose me-pleasing behaviors, the more they will take root in your life.</span>\n\n### “Me Pleasing”\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For instance, if you would like to listen to a particular radio station, put it on.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If you would like to order ham on your pizza, order ham on your pizza. If you would like to talk about your favorite movie, strike up a conversation about it.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Take a moment to identify what “me” would like to do, and as much as you can, insert these me pleasing behaviors into your interactions with others.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Let yourself off the hook for the people pleasing, but do your best to add in some me pleasing as often as you can.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There’s no sense in beating yourself up when you notice that you’ve been tap dancing around your friends, family or coworkers. However, in any moment you can always ask yourself “what’s something*** I***would enjoy?” and you can add a little more personal enjoyment into the interaction.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Of course, it’s always easier to start with smaller behaviors that are fairly comfortable, and work your way up. It might be a challenge to call your mom out for her shit or insist on doing something you know she’s going to hate.  Start small by pushing your comfort level a little further than usual.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In time it will get easier and easier to act authentically and on your own behalf.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Just remember…</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Your feelings are important. In fact, they are the most important feelings in your world. Ignore your own wants and needs and you’re setting yourself up for feeling like you always come second in your own life.</span>\n\nIt’s completely justifiable to put yourself first in your own life. In fact, it’s the best thing you can do for you, and for the world!\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Take care of your own needs and wants, and you’ll be better equipped to be the best person you can be. This benefits us all tremendously. If you really want to uplift the people you care about, you’ll be the greatest influence when you act from a place of strength and authenticity.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span>\n\n*(Law of Attraction coach & educator)*\n\n### Are you a student of the Law of Attraction?\n\nSign up for my free [Law of Attraction newsletter](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&id=db39a47128 \"subscribe\") for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.  You can also become a member of my LOA member website and gain access to a library of video tutorials, ebooks, audiobooks and meditations.  Learn how to attract the things you want with fun, clarity and success!   Join today for as little as[ $1.99](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=1 \"become a member for just $1.99!\") or become an annual member for [30% in savings](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=2 \"annual member\").\n\n*Article Source: This article was originally published at [Raise Your Vibration Today](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/08/are-you-a-people-pleaser-easy-trick/) and has been reposted with permission from the author.*\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

The Facebook  generation started in 1996 with Facebook and its members are born today, too. They are often called ”turn of the millenium generation,” and the most recent term is ”digital natives.”\n\nThey have grown up with the new technologies (computer, mobile phone, Internet), and they are hardly able to imagine their life without these. The services offered by the new technologies are part of their daily life, they are conveniently at home in the online world of the Internet. *Belonging to virtual communities (e. g. Facebook) is more important for them than building personal connections*.\n\nThey spend less and less time reading, and more and more time playing computer games. They are able to occupy themselves with several things simultaneously; they are used to receiving large amounts of information in a short time. But the way they manage information has been transformed, as the vast amounts of information they receive online is overwhelming, and they do not have time to process and arrange it. A lot of it soon loses actuality, so very often people do not remember the information itself, but the way of accessing it. For them, information should be interesting, and not so much its reality or accuracy.\n\nIn this way, they receive a lot of information that is unsuited to their age, and they are emotionally unable to cope with it. The rapid stream of information leaves no time for people to process and arrange it; freshly shared information is coming in from minute to minute, and because of the lack of meta-communication, the information itself is often misunderstood.\n\n*[The human Mind ](http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/2015/01/the-power-of-conditioned-mind.html)has been conditioned by traditions and social expectations for centuries. T[he conditioned patterns of behaviour](https://egoalertnessconsciousness.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/9-things-to-know-abouth-the-fixed-conditioned-mental-patterns/) constitute personal identity and provide the foundations for human behaviour. *\n\nNowadays, however, the ”Facebook generation” is a lot more difficult to condition in the old ways, since for them traditions–religious or social–are much less important than these were for the previous generations.\n\nIt is closely related with the fact that the mind of the new generation is more open to new things, and the handling of the immense amounts of information requires an entirely new attitude and way of thinking. The safe shelter of traditions is now lost, the openness of the new generations make them exposed and vulnerable in the stream of large amounts of information.\n\n**The Collection of our Masks**\n\n*In our daily life we tend to cover our real face with a set of masks. Our personal identity is the collection of our various masks. We immediately put on one of those masks whenever we are not alone.* Whenever there is another person in the room with us, one of our masks is automatically fixed on our face, matching the situation and the other person.\n\nWe ourselves have created these masks unconsciously, under the influence of our parents and teachers, in the course of our life. As a child we made efforts to meet all the innumerable expectations of society reaching us through our parents and teachers. *Perhaps the first of these masks is that of the ”good kid” mask, as our conditioned us to the behavioural patterns of a good child. Then, as we grow up, the number of our masks begin to increase steadily.*\n\nIn our daily life, we need a wide range of masks, as we encounter a large number of different situations and people, and we have a suitable mask for every situation. We tend to behave differently with our boss or with our subordinates, with our children, with our husband and wife, with our friends and with our enemies. Our identity is therefore made up by the collection of our masks that we show to the outside world, and very often we are not even aware of that. These mask were imposed upon us by society, and after a while we begin to identify with the masks. We have eventually completely identified with the masks.\n\n*The online world even further increases the number of our masks, as it offers us the possibility to assume a new identity, that is, the online personality.* This is the mask that we hold up in front of us when we are online. A lot of us have several of such masks, meeting the demands of the specific online communities we are in connection with. The online masks used in cyberspace play an increasingly important role at the new generation, the Facebook-community when they formulate their own identity. *The** online personality is necessary to protect its bearer against the dangers of the new world, or to place the bearer into a position that the individual would never be able to achieve in the real world.*\n\nAt more and more members of the Facebook generation we witness that they increasingly identify with their online personality. *These masks are so closely attached to them, the persons so strongly identify with their masks that they have alrwady forgotten about their original face. It affects the relationship of these people with others*.\n\n*** ****** *****Supermarket and the Santa Claus Feeling**\n\n*Our real identity is, however, hidden deeply under these masks.* The glue of identification fixes these daily masks on us so powerfully that we feel almost entirely the same as the masks. *The insistence of the Facebook-generation on their masks is a lot more powerful than the way most ordinary people stick to their own daily masks*.\n\nThe reason why they tend to insist on their a masks more powerfully than other people is that these young people do not need to face the disappointments and suffering of the real world, as they can be anyone in the fantasies of the cyberworld. If they dislike any of their online masks, they can quickly make a new one, or they are present in cyberspace with several masks, even opposing ones, at the same time. They submerge into a world that they have themselves created and where their possibilities are endless. That is how they drift farther and farther away from the Miracle, and sink even deeper into a dream, a cyber-dream.\n\n*Some young people, however, have already reached the boundaries of that cyber-dreamworld, and they talk about strange experiences.* I have recently read the confessions of two teenage boys about how they see the world now and what their ideas about it are.\n\n*One of them says the following*: ”I called my experience the *supermarket-feeling.* Not that it overcomes me in supermarkets only. Sometimes I have it at school celebrations or in the middle of a railway station. I do not think I sense it coming, or it overcomes me because I do one particular thing that triggers it, it simply occurs. Then I am standing there in a supermarket, and lots of people with their shopping trolleys march before me–the whole life. While I am standing there, I feel like crying. There is only one question left in me there, and that is: ’Why?’”\n\n*The confession of another young person*: ”Do you remember, when we were finally told that Santa Claus was not real, it was just a big game, in which everybody participated, parents, teachers, older brothers, absolutely everybody? Just when the big secret was revealed, were we able to return to our normal daily activities, without playing roles and whispering into ears behind the back of others. I saw the world in a similar way. Everything was very mysterious, like a big game, that was the only way it could be, and in no other way. Everybody cooperated, everybody played their role very well. Every human being, the Earth, the oceans and the stars, was involved in the great game. Only I was not; not yet. I unconsciously realized, more and more clearly, that I had to wait for that revelation. I started to hope strongly that I would be able to see through the scene, and then real life would begin for me finally. But, as opposed to the tale of Santa Claus, nobody ever calls you to tall you the secret. I had to make the discovery myself, I was sure. Only then would the confusion in connection with appearance and reality clear up. There is no other way.”\n\n**The Awakening of the Facebook Generation**\n\nThe confessions above indicate that the youngsters unconsciously sensed that the masks–no matter how ordinary they are–false, *they do not belong to these masks, and it is not the masks that constitute their real identity. *They also sensed that *nobody was going to show them the way out of the mental confusion in connection with appearance and reality*, and they themselves had to find it.\n\nIf you also belong to the Facebook generation, it is essential to pay attention to these emotions and do not just disregard them offhand. *These emotions show that [the Consciousness](https://egoalertnessconsciousness.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/3-stages-in-the-evolution-of-the-human-spirit-ego-alertness-consciousness/) that is dormant in your present state of ordinary consciousness, begins to wake up, and no longer identifies with the forms and shapes.*\n\nThis awakening means that your nicely constructed and allegedly impenetrable personal identity begins to crumble and you find yourself in an empty space, where you are able to witness the dance of forms and shapes like an external observer. *This is experiencing the Miracle, the witnessing Presence. *\n\nThis experience, this Presence is the gate you may step through towards the Miracle, to the quiet of your real Self. That is why it is *important that you should not be scared of that experience, do not begin to rebuild your former identity, do not be closed into the ordinary ways of the mind. Remain in the experience, and submit to the Miracle of Consciousness! *\n\nFrom the book>> : [Frank M.

The Facebook  generation started in 1996 with Facebook and its members are born today, too. They are often called ”turn of the millenium generation,” and the most recent term is ”digital natives.”</p>\n<p>They have grown up with the new technologies (computer, mobile phone, Internet), and they are hardly able to imagine their life without these. The services offered by the new technologies are part of their daily life, they are conveniently at home in the online world of the Internet. <em>Belonging to virtual communities (e. g. Facebook) is more important for them than building personal connections</em>.</p>\n<p>They spend less and less time reading, and more and more time playing computer games. They are able to occupy themselves with several things simultaneously; they are used to receiving large amounts of information in a short time. But the way they manage information has been transformed, as the vast amounts of information they receive online is overwhelming, and they do not have time to process and arrange it. A lot of it soon loses actuality, so very often people do not remember the information itself, but the way of accessing it. For them, information should be interesting, and not so much its reality or accuracy.</p>\n<p>In this way, they receive a lot of information that is unsuited to their age, and they are emotionally unable to cope with it.

It’s also found that nuts help<strong> <a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/02/05/jn.113.182907\">improve cholesterol levels</a> </strong>and blood pressure levels only 4 hours after people eat nuts or consume nut oils.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers <strong><a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/02/05/jn.113.182907\">conducting the study</a></strong> were the first to identify the compounds in walnuts that are responsible for such amazing health benefits. They note that by eating even just three tablespoons of walnut oil, the health of your blood vessels will improve within 4 hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is due to nut oils increasing the flexibility of blood vessels. Nut oils particularly benefit endothelial cells, which are the cells that line each of our blood vessels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve been looking for a healthy practice to add to your already healthy life, or if you’re just starting on your quest towards being healthier, a handful of walnuts each day is a good (and easy) place to start!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And only by consuming a handful of walnuts or walnut oil for four days in a week you can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease,” said Dr. Penny Kris Etherton, professor of nutrition at Penn State University in Pennsylvania.</span></p>\n<p>h/t: <a href=\"http://www.realfarmacy.com/5-walnuts-4-hours/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RealFarmacy</strong></a></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

                "markdown": "\n### By [Vivienne Micallef-Browne](https://empowerastrology.org)\n\n### **And we’re going to let it burn!**\n\n**The New Moon solar eclipse at 9 degrees Virgo on the 1st September, 09:01 UTC**\n\n**Eclipses are the most powerful transits that you can experience. They herald major beginnings and endings, burning and purifying.**\n\n**Solar Eclipses tend to create new beginnings and bright new opportunities.**  \n**Usually, they are exciting, are often very positive, and bring news out of the blue.**\n\n**This Solar Eclipse in Virgo is immensely significant, the major activity cycle for 2016 begins now. The North Node and Virgo-Jupiter are highly active.**\n\n**We have been building up and preparing for this event of the New Moon Solar Eclipse and the month of September all year!**\n\n**We are about to be rapidly transported onto the next level of our evolutionary development.**\n\nWe have two powerful eclipses back to back in September. The Solar eclipse on the 1st September and a Lunar eclipse on the 16th September.\n\nWe will all feel the effects of the two eclipses but even more so if you have personal planets in your horoscope that are directly aspected by the eclipse.\n\n**Eclipses can uproot us, surprise us, and get us moving. They shake us up so that we can move from one level of maturity to another, to a higher plane, very rapidly. Eclipses want us to change, and change we do!**\n\n**Anything that we have been holding onto that no longer serves our highest purpose will fall away during the two eclipses in September. Wheter that be people, circumstances or limiting and negative patterns of thinking and behaving.**\n\nA Solar Eclipse happens when the Earth, Moon and Sun are perfectly aligned in a straight line and Moon covers the Sun’s centre, leaving the Sun’s visible outer edges to form a “ring of fire” or around the Moon.\n\n**The moon is in the heart of the Sun. The Sun is burning away and purifying everything that no longer serves our highest good.**\n\n**The eclipse is burning away self-doubt and delusions. You will know what is right and what is good for you.**\n\n**It is a powerful inner purification of Matter, Consciousness and Spirit.**\n\nThe Sun is our conscious sense of self, our sense of life purpose, our will and our ability to radiate our essence. The Moon is our feelings, our memory, our needs, and our personal access to our creative source and our unconscious.\n\n**When the Moon obscures the Sun, as in a Solar Eclipse, it allows something from the unconscious to leak out past the brilliant light of the conscious self.**\n\n**The eclipse can provide the necessary catalyst to overcome a circumstance, obstacle (Saturn) or illusion (Neptune)**\n\n**Any last baggage has to go. We need to travel light as our new path is unfolding, we need to be prepared. We will be rapidly pushed along in a new direction, to our higher path and consciousness. Leaving the past and the old ways behind forever.**\n\nOur lives will then rapidly move forward, carrying us to the next level. And to a new and better way of relating to love, to our relationships and to free ourselves of Self-limiting beliefs.\n\n**We have the opportunity to burn away old karma in love and dysfunctional patterns forever.**\n\n**This is heart opening energy**\n\n**The eclipse happens at the same time as one of the best aspects of the year, Jupiter Conjunct Venus in Virgo.**\n\n**This eclipse is under the best possible influences promising us success, happiness, growth and abundance whatever occurrences and changes may happen in September.**\n\n**Jupiter and Venus are at their closest now and won’t be this close again until 2065. So the energy is extremely strong and significant.**\n\nMercury, the ruler of the eclipse, is conjunct Jupiter and Venus.Jupiter expands everything it touches, expanding our capacity to feel joy, love and happiness and bringing good vibes, joy, love abundance and wisdom.\n\n**Jupiter is expanding our consciousness and our hearts.**\n\n**We are essentially reaping the rewards in September for all our hard won efforts, spiritually, physically and materially in September.**\n\nMercury turns retrograde on the 30th August until the 22nd September.Mercury governs our rational mind and communication. Mercury retrograde helps us to turn inward and reflect. Conjunct Jupiter and Venus we are able to access inner wisdom and joy.  \n**The Mercury retrograde will give us a chance to rethink and revalue the path we are on, so that any doubts we may have through the September eclipse season about where we are heading and our life’s purpose, will become clearer to us by the end of September.**\n\nChiron, the wounded healer, is in opposition to Jupiter and Mercury, we can gain much healing, insight wisdom and love during the retrograde period, helping to confirm that we are on the right path, as much will be changing fast and rapidly during the September eclipse period.\n\nChiron the Shaman and wounded healer is also in Pisces, in exact opposition to Jupiter. Jupiter is on a mission to find the truth. Healing is to be found in the truth.\n\nWe will feel clearer, more positive and self-confident about any major decisions or changes to be made by the end of September when Mercury turns direct.\n\n**And ultimately we are being guided towards a higher conscious state, higher forms of love and happiness in our lives.**\n\nIndeed, with Mars in Sagittarius exactly square the nodes of fate on the day of the retrograde 30th August, we are being pushed to evolve and step up to our life’s purpose and path whether we are ready or not.\n\nThe new moon and sun in Virgo are in opposition to Neptune in Pisces. Highlighting The Virgo- Pisces Axis.which symbolises is the connection between Mind, Body and Spirit.\n\nThe Virgo Solar Eclipse brings to light any shadow Virgo issues of perfectionism or self-doubt that get in the way of giving our gifts to the world, with fear often being behind these thoughts. The Virgo part of all of us is learning to understand perfection as a process and practice, not an result, and the best way to perfect our skills is to use them. Start where you are, take the first small step, and then the next step will become clear.\n\nWhen Virgo spends to much time in her mind, she loses her connection with her emotions, Soul and Spirit, leading to anxiety and excessive worrying that can have mental and physical effects. Between the need to let go of knowing every last detail and learn to accept what is, as it is. Until the analytical Virgo learns to see the bigger picture to trust and go with the flow, they will not be able to live a balanced life.  \n**Watch out for any major insights, opportunities, developments or meetings with significant new people or from the past throughout September, but especially on the 4th September, when the Sun in Virgo meets up in an exact conjunction with the the north node of fate at 12 degrees Virgo.**\n\nSaturn in Sagittarius is helping us to master, focus with perseverance and staying power our minds, talents, skills, healing powers and techniques (Virgo). While Mars manifests and puts them into action.\n\nWith Mars and Saturn in Sagittarius the teacher of knowledge and wisdom, Virgo and Neptune the healer and the spiritualist, conjunct the nodes of fate, many feel called to the teaching, healing and spiritual professions at this moment in time.\n\n**Mars in the fire sign of Sagittarius is breaking through all limitations and Jupiter and Venus shining brightly and visibly to the naked eye currently in the night sky, its time to ignite your inner fire, for a renewed passion for life!**  \n Mars in Sagittarius is about to make a positive aspect (trine) to the revolutionary planet of Uranus and Eris the awakener, both in Aries the middle of September and Jupiter is entering Libra (love, harmony, justice) on 9th September together they are paving the way for the:\n\n**Revolution of Love!**\n\nAs well as healing, (Chiron) awakening (Uranus, Eris) and fairness and Justice for all and not the few.

They herald major beginnings and endings, burning and purifying.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solar Eclipses tend to create new beginnings and bright new opportunities.</strong><br />\n<strong>Usually, they are exciting, are often very positive, and bring news out of the blue.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This Solar Eclipse in Virgo is immensely significant, the major activity cycle for 2016 begins now. The North Node and Virgo-Jupiter are highly active.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We have been building up and preparing for this event of the New Moon Solar Eclipse and the month of September all year!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We are about to be rapidly transported onto the next level of our evolutionary development.</strong></p>\n<p>We have two powerful eclipses back to back in September. The Solar eclipse on the 1st September and a Lunar eclipse on the 16th September.</p>\n<p>We will all feel the effects of the two eclipses but even more so if you have personal planets in your horoscope that are directly aspected by the eclipse.</p>\n<p><strong>Eclipses can uproot us, surprise us, and get us moving. They shake us up so that we can move from one level of maturity to another, to a higher plane, very rapidly. Eclipses want us to change, and change we do!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anything that we have been holding onto that no longer serves our highest purpose will fall away during the two eclipses in September. Wheter that be people, circumstances or limiting and negative patterns of thinking and behaving.</strong></p>\n<p>A Solar Eclipse happens when the Earth, Moon and Sun are perfectly aligned in a straight line and Moon covers the Sun’s centre, leaving the Sun’s visible outer edges to form a “ring of fire” or around the Moon.</p>\n<p><strong>The moon is in the heart of the Sun. The Sun is burning away and purifying everything that no longer serves our highest good.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The eclipse is burning away self-doubt and delusions. You will know what is right and what is good for you.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It is a powerful inner purification of Matter, Consciousness and Spirit.</strong></p>\n<p>The Sun is our conscious sense of self, our sense of life purpose, our will and our ability to radiate our essence. The Moon is our feelings, our memory, our needs, and our personal access to our creative source and our unconscious.</p>\n<p><strong>When the Moon obscures the Sun, as in a Solar Eclipse, it allows something from the unconscious to leak out past the brilliant light of the conscious self.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The eclipse can provide the necessary catalyst to overcome a circumstance, obstacle (Saturn) or illusion (Neptune)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Any last baggage has to go. We need to travel light as our new path is unfolding, we need to be prepared. We will be rapidly pushed along in a new direction, to our higher path and consciousness. Leaving the past and the old ways behind forever.</strong></p>\n<p>Our lives will then rapidly move forward, carrying us to the next level. And to a new and better way of relating to love, to our relationships and to free ourselves of Self-limiting beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong>We have the opportunity to burn away old karma in love and dysfunctional patterns forever.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is heart opening energy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The eclipse happens at the same time as one of the best aspects of the year, Jupiter Conjunct Venus in Virgo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This eclipse is under the best possible influences promising us success, happiness, growth and abundance whatever occurrences and changes may happen in September.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jupiter and Venus are at their closest now and won’t be this close again until 2065. So the energy is extremely strong and significant.</strong></p>\n<p>Mercury, the ruler of the eclipse, is conjunct Jupiter and Venus.Jupiter expands everything it touches, expanding our capacity to feel joy, love and happiness and bringing good vibes, joy, love abundance and wisdom.</p>\n<p><strong>Jupiter is expanding our consciousness and our hearts.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We are essentially reaping the rewards in September for all our hard won efforts, spiritually, physically and materially in September.</strong></p>\n<p>Mercury turns retrograde on the 30th August until the 22nd September.Mercury governs our rational mind and communication. Mercury retrograde helps us to turn inward and reflect. Conjunct Jupiter and Venus we are able to access inner wisdom and joy.<br />\n<strong>The Mercury retrograde will give us a chance to rethink and revalue the path we are on, so that any doubts we may have through the September eclipse season about where we are heading and our life’s purpose, will become clearer to us by the end of September.</strong></p>\n<p>Chiron, the wounded healer, is in opposition to Jupiter and Mercury, we can gain much healing, insight wisdom and love during the retrograde period, helping to confirm that we are on the right path, as much will be changing fast and rapidly during the September eclipse period.</p>\n<p>Chiron the Shaman and wounded healer is also in Pisces, in exact opposition to Jupiter. Jupiter is on a mission to find the truth. Healing is to be found in the truth.</p>\n<p>We will feel clearer, more positive and self-confident about any major decisions or changes to be made by the end of September when Mercury turns direct.</p>\n<p><strong>And ultimately we are being guided towards a higher conscious state, higher forms of love and happiness in our lives.</strong></p>\n<p>Indeed, with Mars in Sagittarius exactly square the nodes of fate on the day of the retrograde 30th August, we are being pushed to evolve and step up to our life’s purpose and path whether we are ready or not.</p>\n<p>The new moon and sun in Virgo are in opposition to Neptune in Pisces. Highlighting The Virgo- Pisces Axis.which symbolises is the connection between Mind, Body and Spirit.</p>\n<p>The Virgo Solar Eclipse brings to light any shadow Virgo issues of perfectionism or self-doubt that get in the way of giving our gifts to the world, with fear often being behind these thoughts. The Virgo part of all of us is learning to understand perfection as a process and practice, not an result, and the best way to perfect our skills is to use them. Start where you are, take the first small step, and then the next step will become clear.</p>\n<p>When Virgo spends to much time in her mind, she loses her connection with her emotions, Soul and Spirit, leading to anxiety and excessive worrying that can have mental and physical effects. Between the need to let go of knowing every last detail and learn to accept what is, as it is. Until the analytical Virgo learns to see the bigger picture to trust and go with the flow, they will not be able to live a balanced life.<br />\n<strong>Watch out for any major insights, opportunities, developments or meetings with significant new people or from the past throughout September, but especially on the 4th September, when the Sun in Virgo meets up in an exact conjunction with the the north node of fate at 12 degrees Virgo.</strong></p>\n<p>Saturn in Sagittarius is helping us to master, focus with perseverance and staying power our minds, talents, skills, healing powers and techniques (Virgo). While Mars manifests and puts them into action.</p>\n<p>With Mars and Saturn in Sagittarius the teacher of knowledge and wisdom, Virgo and Neptune the healer and the spiritualist, conjunct the nodes of fate, many feel called to the teaching, healing and spiritual professions at this moment in time.</p>\n<p><strong>Mars in the fire sign of Sagittarius is breaking through all limitations and Jupiter and Venus shining brightly and visibly to the naked eye currently in the night sky, its time to ignite your inner fire, for a renewed passion for life!</strong><br />\nMars in Sagittarius is about to make a positive aspect (trine) to the revolutionary planet of Uranus and Eris the awakener, both in Aries the middle of September and Jupiter is entering Libra (love, harmony, justice) on 9th September together they are paving the way for the:</p>\n<p><strong>Revolution of Love!</strong></p>\n<p>As well as healing, (Chiron) awakening (Uranus, Eris) and fairness and Justice for all and not the few. (Jupiter in Libra)</p>\n<p>On both a personal and collective level.<br />\n<strong>We will find the September energies positively culminating on the New Moon in Libra September 30th together with Jupiter in Libra heralding a new healthy paradigm for better relationships and love.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>With many karmic lovers meeting and coming together during the Jupiter in Libra transit from September 9th 2016to October 2017</strong></p>\n<p><b>“Burn”</b></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><strong>“We, we don’t have to worry ’bout nothing</strong><br />\n<strong>‘Cause we got the fire, and we’re burning one hell of a something</strong><br />\n<strong>They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space</strong><br />\n<strong>Light it up, like we’re the stars of the human race, human race</strong><strong> When the light started out they don’t know what they heard</strong><br />\n<strong>Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world</strong><br />\n<strong>We’ll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky</strong><br />\n<strong>‘Cause we got the fire, fire, fire</strong><br />\n<strong>Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire</strong><strong>And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn”</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Ellie Goulding</strong></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>Youtube song :<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGyEd0aKWZE\">Burn</a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Full credits to <a href=\"https://empowerastrology.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Vivienne Micallef-Browne</strong></a></div>\n<div></div>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

As we progress forward with more enlightened attitudes toward assisted suicide, we’ll undoubtedly start to see more stories like Betsy Davis.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This 41-year-old painter and performance artist decided to take matters into her own hands after being diagnosed with ALS (**[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis](http://www.alsa.org/about-als/what-is-als.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/)**), a neurodegenerative disease that slowly kills nerve cells found in the brain and spinal cord.</span>\n\n![](http://cdn2.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2016/08/1J5bY1dRgKae936c68daee105641-3735194-Amanda_Friedland_left_adjusts_her_friend_Betsy_Davis_s_sash_as_s-a-8_1470947909380-600x398.jpg)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She planned a party that would be held over the course of two days and which 30 friends and loved ones would be invited to. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “These circumstances are unlike any party you have attended before, requiring emotional stamina, centeredness, and openness,” reads her invitations.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Betsy also made it clear that she only had one rule for attending the party: no crying in front of her.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Betsy’s body was slowly starting to shut down, and this party was her way of not only saying goodbye to her loved ones, but also of letting them know that it would all be okay.

I can’t believe how much effort and frustration I used to invest in those smaller concerns.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you can relate to my early years and at times worry that you don’t have what it takes to make things happen with the Law of Attraction, please remember that all you have to do is put one foot in front of the other. Stay optimistic and keep learning and you will do big things with your life. I guarantee it!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>(Law of Attraction coach &amp; educator)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Are you a student of the Law of Attraction?</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sign up for my free <a title=\"subscribe\" href=\"http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&amp;id=db39a47128\" target=\"_blank\">Law of Attraction newsletter</a> for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.  You can also become a member of my LOA member website and gain access to a library of video tutorials, ebooks, audiobooks and meditations.  Learn how to attract the things you want with fun, clarity and success!   Join today for as little as<a title=\"become a member for just $1.99!\" href=\"https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=1\" target=\"_blank\"> $1.99</a> or become an annual member for <a title=\"annual member\" href=\"https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/membership-checkout/?level=2\" target=\"_blank\">30% in savings</a>.</p>\n<p>Article Source: This article was originally published at <a href=\"http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/08/31/law-of-attraction-when-times-are-tough/\">Raise Your Vibration Today</a> and has been republished with permission from the author.</p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

But even that failed when Bruno almost hung himself trying to get out one day. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since then, Larry has come to terms with Bruno’s frequent journeys and has even gotten used to the numerous people who call him explaining they’ve found his dog. They’re usually confused when Larry tells them that Bruno is fine and that he’ll make his way home by himself eventually.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Longville has become accustomed to Bruno’s visits, so much so that they now look forward to him coming every day. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bruno usually frequents the city hall, the library, the ice cream shop, the grocery store, and several other shops around town. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, to show their appreciation for Bruno, they even erected a carved wooden statue of him and dubbed him the town’s ambassador!</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZxSX3IeO7MA?feature=oembed\" width=\"620\"></iframe>\n\n> [Every Day This Old Dog Walks 4 Miles To Town Just To Say Hi To Everyone](http://www.boredpanda.com/dog-4-mile-walk-to-town-bruno-longville/)\n\n<iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pqXmQfERVx\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"http://www.boredpanda.com/dog-4-mile-walk-to-town-bruno-longville/embed/#?secret=pqXmQfERVx\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"“Every Day This Old Dog Walks 4 Miles To Town Just To Say Hi To Everyone” — Bored Panda\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

They’re masters at getting so anxious and worked up about the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possibility</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of things going wrong, that they end up projecting this fear and this negative energy onto the person they’re with at the moment, which usually causes things to go very, very wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>They’re often single by choice</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many intelligent people recognize the benefits of being single, or simply prefer it. If they’re more comfortable flying solo, then you can assume that that’s what they’re going to do. If you’re concerned about them being alone, don’t be; they’ve likely made the choice to be single, rather than being forced into it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they’re entirely comfortable being their own company.</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

Why? Because the nitrates found in beets help**[improve endurance](http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/4/1144.long)**, and they turn your pee pink. One study that had cyclists pedal to exhaustion over a certain period of time, found that cyclists who drank beet juice could pedal their hardest for **[15 percent longer](http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/4/1144.long)** than the control group.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll need anywhere from three to five beets to boost your performance, and you’ll want to eat them at least two to three hours before you need their enhancing effects.</span>\n\n**Improved Brain Function**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned previously, the nitrates found in beets help dilate blood vessels, improving blood circulation. It’s been seen that the body’s ability to convert nitrates into nitric oxide slows down as we grow older. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2010 study found that people who consumed diets high in nitrates for at least two days received more blood flow to their **[brain’s frontal lobe](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018552/)**; an area of the brain associated with one’s attention to detail, and ability to focus and organize.</span>\n\n**Your liver will be healthier**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The liver is the organ in our bodies that is responsible for cleaning everything up.

In people, it’s been seen to improve liver function, reduce cholesterol a tiny bit, and reduce the size of the liver itself.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

One study that had cyclists pedal to exhaustion over a certain period of time, found that cyclists who drank beet juice could pedal their hardest for <strong><a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/4/1144.long\">15 percent longer</a></strong> than the control group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll need anywhere from three to five beets to boost your performance, and you’ll want to eat them at least two to three hours before you need their enhancing effects.</span></p>\n<p><b>Improved Brain Function</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned previously, the nitrates found in beets help dilate blood vessels, improving blood circulation. It’s been seen that the body’s ability to convert nitrates into nitric oxide slows down as we grow older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2010 study found that people who consumed diets high in nitrates for at least two days received more blood flow to their <strong><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018552/\">brain’s frontal lobe</a></strong>; an area of the brain associated with one’s attention to detail, and ability to focus and organize.</span></p>\n<p><b>Your liver will be healthier</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The liver is the organ in our bodies that is responsible for cleaning everything up. It filters our blood, and you can give it a helping hand by eating your beets every day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/3/539.full\">Betaine</a></strong>, the aforementioned healthy amino acid found in beets, has been seen to prevent and even decrease the amount of fat that ends up in the liver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies on animals have found that beet juice increases levels of healthy enzymes in the bloodstream. In people, it’s been seen to improve liver function, reduce cholesterol a tiny bit, and reduce the size of the liver itself.</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

Your actions </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">now</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> will have a direct influence on what happens to you </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">later</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Which is ultimately why our fates are not written in stone.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we do good deeds for others, like buying the coffee of the next person in line or giving a homeless person a meal, we create a ripple effect. There’s now a possibility that this person we’ve helped will “pay it forward” by doing a good deed of their own, and there’s a chance that we created a positive energy source with our actions.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are five laws of Karma that can change your life:</span>\n\n**The Great Law – “As you sow, so shall you reap.”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To explain this law simply: every single action we perform and thought that we have has a consequence, be it good or bad. In order to achieve what we desire most, whether it be love, peace, or prosperity, we must be willing to shift our being into alignment with our desires. </span>\n\n**The Law of Creation – “What we desire comes through participation”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The reality that we’ve all been born into has been shaped by the intentions of others over the course of time. Because we are all intertwined as one in the universe, it is our intentions and willfulness that shape creation. Surround yourself with people and objects that are in line with your deepest desires.</span>\n\n**The Law of Humility – “Refusal to accept what is”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Acceptance is a universal theme for various different systems of belief, and with good reason. We cannot begin to change our reality if we are in complete denial about every aspect of that reality. When we choose to think about the negative, instead of taking action to change the negative, we’re only furthering rumination and stagnation.</span>\n\n**The Law of Here and Now – “The Present is all we have”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we find ourselves thinking about the past, wishing we did things differently, or when we’re worrying about an uncertain future, we take away our chance at seizing opportunities in the present. We cannot move forward if we’re not living in the moment.</span>\n\n**The Law of Patience and Reward – “Nothing of value is created without a patient mindset”**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are rarely shortcuts in life, and wishful thinking is not one of them. You cannot achieve all of your goals and desires immediately. Only with great patience and a persistent work ethic can we reap our greatest rewards, and the lasting joy that comes with them.</span>\n\nhttps://www.powerofpositivity.com/12-laws-of-karma-that-will-change-your-life/\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

When we choose to think about the negative, instead of taking action to change the negative, we’re only furthering rumination and stagnation.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Law of Here and Now &#8211; “The Present is all we have”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we find ourselves thinking about the past, wishing we did things differently, or when we’re worrying about an uncertain future, we take away our chance at seizing opportunities in the present. We cannot move forward if we’re not living in the moment.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Law of Patience and Reward &#8211; “Nothing of value is created without a patient mindset”</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are rarely shortcuts in life, and wishful thinking is not one of them. You cannot achieve all of your goals and desires immediately. Only with great patience and a persistent work ethic can we reap our greatest rewards, and the lasting joy that comes with them.</span></p>\n<p>https://www.powerofpositivity.com/12-laws-of-karma-that-will-change-your-life/</p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>",

                "markdown": "\n \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bananas are one fruit that seem to be “hit or miss” regarding how many people like to eat them. For example, I love bananas. I eat one probably every day. But my best friend (and roommate) absolutely loathes them. He can barely even stand the smell for some reason. And my girlfriend won’t eat them unless they’re somewhat green, or “fresh” as she describes them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the United States, bananas are consumed the most out of all the fruits, even being eaten more often than apples and oranges. Whenever you purchase fruit, you can kind of gauge what they will taste like based on how long ago you purchased them. Usually the day you buy fruit, it’s not very ripe. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like with bananas, my girlfriend will only eat unripe bananas that have been bought recently. And I know a large number of people that will not touch a banana if it’s bruised and covered in black spots. But that’s a terrible mindset to have when it comes to bananas!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As bananas continue to ripen, sure they develop these dark spots, but they also become more healthy and nutritious for you. Banana’s TNF levels increase as they become more ripe. TNF, or tumor necrosis factor, is a cancer-fighting compound that helps destroy abnormal cells in the body.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High levels of TNF and antioxidants from bananas help strengthen our immune system and can help generate more white blood cells! So, next time you want to pass up the black-spotted banana, think about your health! They might look unappealing, but they taste the same and are packed with nutrition.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating bananas provide a number of other health benefits as well. Here are just a few that come to mind:</span>\n\n**Heartburn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bananas are a natural antacid that can help relieve symptoms of heartburn and acid reflux. </span>\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bananas have low sodium levels and high potassium levels, which helps lower blood pressure and prevent heart attack and stroke.</span>\n\n**Depression**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bananas contain high levels of tryptophan, a compound that our bodies use to create serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps improve mood, promotes relaxation, and makes people feel a bit happier. If you’re depressed, add bananas to your diet.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

When we have partners for long periods of time, we grow together in many ways. We get used to having them as active participants in our life. Having to change the way you think about them and how you act toward them can be devastating.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, we must remember that we are still traveling along on our personal journeys through this world. The end of one relationship can make room for the next big chapter of your life. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will continue to move forward without them, experiencing life fully, if you can remember these five things during your troubled time:</span>\n\n**You learn from your mistakes**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each time you and a partner decide to split up, there’s usually a lesson to be learned by both of you. If you can figure out what this lesson is, you can learn from it and move forward knowing you won’t make the same mistake twice. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we break up with a person, we heal and grow into a better person over time. Use this newfound freedom to explore who you are </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right now</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so you can be ready for the next opportunity.</span>\n\n**The relationship might have been a bit too fiery**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes when our soul mates make their way into our lives it’s with a fiery passion that burns hot and fast. Particularly when we start seeing someone who is basically a mirror image of ourselves. When two of the same type of people come together, there’s bound to be problems.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do your best to recognize that this person just wasn’t meant to be in your life in that way. It’s simply a matter of compatibility more so than anything else.</span>\n\n**Timing can be everything**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes two people come together simply out of convenience. When we’re traveling along on our paths and another person’s path is traveling right along side our own, it’s incredibly easy to build a connection.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that just because things are easy, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are good. If you’re worried about never finding that easiness again, know that you will.</span>\n\n**Worrying about them won’t make things easier on you**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a breakup happens, both parties are feeling guilty. The unfortunate truth is that, in order to heal properly, you have to rid your mind of any thoughts concerning this person. You can’t be worried about their well-being right now; you have to focus on you and your own happiness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Letting go of them will ultimately be what sets you free.</span>\n\n**They weren’t there to solve your life’s problems**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some of us, it can be hard to remember to be independent outside of a relationship. Sometimes we enter into one, and then completely forget how to function alone. If you’re feeling afraid that this person won’t be there to help you anymore, you need to remember that you don’t really need anyone else’s help, and that you can’t rely on others for your own happiness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This person may have made your life a little easier by taking on some of the responsibility, but you’re entirely capable of being happy on your own. Never become dependent on someone else for the happiness in your life.</span>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",

                "slug": "temp-slug-2728",
                "markdown": "\nby [Frank M. Wanderer](http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/) Ph.D.\n\n \n\nThe ultimate goal of our spiritual quest is Enlightenment, that is what we all wish to achieve.\n\n4 Secrets of the Enlightenment:\n\n**#1.Secret**\n\nEnlightenment is not a remote state of Consciousness that we need to achieve some time in the future, but it is the very heart of our nature.\n\n**#2.Secret**\n\nOur spiritual quest diverts our attention to that imaginary, future state of Consciousness that we believe to be enlightenment. In this way, the spiritual quest detaches and diverts us from our true nature, enlightenment. We are therefore unable to ever reach enlightenment through the process of spiritual quest.\n\n**#3.Secret**\n\nEnlightenment is, as we can now see, our true, inner nature. But what is in our true, inner nature? Unfortunately, during our [spiritual search](http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/2015/12/how-to-exit-matrix-in-6-simple-steps.html), most of us have been alienated from it; so much so, that we have even forgotten about it. It is, however, permanently present in our life, but we simply disregard it. Our attention is always engaged by something, something that we need to deal with, so we very rarely take the trouble of looking into ourself. Still, if we were able to concentrate our attention on ourselves, that brief moment of alert Consciousness would be enough for us to recognize that [the alert Consciousness,](https://egoalertnessconsciousness.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/3-stages-in-the-evolution-of-the-human-spirit-ego-alertness-consciousness/) free of emotions and thoughts is our true inner nature.\n\n**#4.Secret**\n\nWe are now enlightened, we have never been anything else.\n\n> **The question now arise, where that Enlightenment, that alert Consciousness has disappeared from our life?**\n\nAs children, playing free of problems, we live in the present moment, in the state of alert Consciousness (so if we wish to meet an enlightened human being, all we need to do is go out to the nearest playground).\n\nThen, carefree playing was replaced by more serious things in our life. From our parents we learned who we are and what our mission in life is. We were told that we are young human beings, still in the process of developing and shaping, and becoming an adult is a hard work.\n\nCarefree playing was gradually replaced by purpose-oriented work in our life. Our teachers and parents therefore taught as how to set up objectives, how to make plans, and we soon learned that future is more important for us than present. We then concentrated out attention from the vividness of the present moment onto the image our parents and teachers created in us, onto the image we need to become one day. Simultaneously with that process, the impression that we are not what we are supposed to be emerged gradually in our mind.\n\nAs children we simply had no choice, we had to accept the process, we had to identify with the new image. We are therefore moving away from our own inner nature, under the hypnotic attraction of a future goal to be achieved later. It is thus understandable that we look upon enlightenment as a goal to be achieved in the future.\n\nSpurred by our ambitions, we pursue various goals all through our lives. Our whole life is a rush. We chase our desires and unfulfilled dreams. We are attracted by money, power, prestige, a wholesome, happy life. We aspire for something all the time, we always want to achieve something. This restless rush is instigated by our fear that we are still not what we want to be. We are never satisfied, we always want something else, we would like to be better, more beautiful, richer than we are at present.\n\nEverybody nurtures an idealized image of what he/she would like to be like. The mind projects this idealized image into the future, and reveals the way leading to it. But this image requires a constant rush, stress, anxiety and worry in our life, as nothing is free, we have to struggle to achieve our goals.\n\nBut this is not our own personal tragedy, but that of the entire mankind. Generation after generation is conditioned to that attitude by the preceding generations. It is a vicious circle, and breaking out of it is almost impossible.\n\nDuring our[ spiritual journey](http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/2016/03/3-turning-points-during-spiritual.html) we must recognize this process, and we must realize that we no longer need to become something new, as we are all in possession of all the qualities that we have been pursuing so far in our dreams.\n\nWe must make efforts to be present at every moment of our life. That Presence shall bring alert Consciousness back to our life. In the state of alert Consciousness thoughts will no longer keep our attention in captivity, and we may experience silence. In the alert silence we recognize that it is [our real Self ](https://egoalertnessconsciousness.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/12-keys-to-access-the-deeper-dimensions-of-life/)is, it is our real inner nature. Enlightenment is us, we ourselves.\n\n~From the book: [Frank M.

Wanderer</a> Ph.D.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of our spiritual quest is Enlightenment, that is what we all wish to achieve.</p>\n<p>4 Secrets of the Enlightenment:</p>\n<p><strong>#1.Secret</strong></p>\n<p>Enlightenment is not a remote state of Consciousness that we need to achieve some time in the future, but it is the very heart of our nature.</p>\n<p><strong>#2.Secret</strong></p>\n<p>Our spiritual quest diverts our attention to that imaginary, future state of Consciousness that we believe to be enlightenment. In this way, the spiritual quest detaches and diverts us from our true nature, enlightenment. We are therefore unable to ever reach enlightenment through the process of spiritual quest.</p>\n<p><strong>#3.Secret</strong></p>\n<p>Enlightenment is, as we can now see, our true, inner nature. But what is in our true, inner nature? Unfortunately, during our <a href=\"http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/2015/12/how-to-exit-matrix-in-6-simple-steps.html\">spiritual search</a>, most of us have been alienated from it; so much so, that we have even forgotten about it. It is, however, permanently present in our life, but we simply disregard it. Our attention is always engaged by something, something that we need to deal with, so we very rarely take the trouble of looking into ourself. Still, if we were able to concentrate our attention on ourselves, that brief moment of alert Consciousness would be enough for us to recognize that <a href=\"https://egoalertnessconsciousness.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/3-stages-in-the-evolution-of-the-human-spirit-ego-alertness-consciousness/\">the alert Consciousness,</a> free of emotions and thoughts is our true inner nature.</p>\n<p><strong>#4.Secret</strong></p>\n<p>We are now enlightened, we have never been anything else.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The question now arise, where that Enlightenment, that alert Consciousness has disappeared from our life?</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As children, playing free of problems, we live in the present moment, in the state of alert Consciousness (so if we wish to meet an enlightened human being, all we need to do is go out to the nearest playground).</p>\n<p>Then, carefree playing was replaced by more serious things in our life. From our parents we learned who we are and what our mission in life is. We were told that we are young human beings, still in the process of developing and shaping, and becoming an adult is a hard work.</p>\n<p>Carefree playing was gradually replaced by purpose-oriented work in our life. Our teachers and parents therefore taught as how to set up objectives, how to make plans, and we soon learned that future is more important for us than present. We then concentrated out attention from the vividness of the present moment onto the image our parents and teachers created in us, onto the image we need to become one day. Simultaneously with that process, the impression that we are not what we are supposed to be emerged gradually in our mind.</p>\n<p>As children we simply had no choice, we had to accept the process, we had to identify with the new image. We are therefore moving away from our own inner nature, under the hypnotic attraction of a future goal to be achieved later. It is thus understandable that we look upon enlightenment as a goal to be achieved in the future.</p>\n<p>Spurred by our ambitions, we pursue various goals all through our lives. Our whole life is a rush. We chase our desires and unfulfilled dreams. We are attracted by money, power, prestige, a wholesome, happy life. We aspire for something all the time, we always want to achieve something. This restless rush is instigated by our fear that we are still not what we want to be. We are never satisfied, we always want something else, we would like to be better, more beautiful, richer than we are at present.</p>\n<p>Everybody nurtures an idealized image of what he/she would like to be like. The mind projects this idealized image into the future, and reveals the way leading to it. But this image requires a constant rush, stress, anxiety and worry in our life, as nothing is free, we have to struggle to achieve our goals.</p>\n<p>But this is not our own personal tragedy, but that of the entire mankind. Generation after generation is conditioned to that attitude by the preceding generations. It is a vicious circle, and breaking out of it is almost impossible.</p>\n<p>During our<a href=\"http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/2016/03/3-turning-points-during-spiritual.html\"> spiritual journey</a> we must recognize this process, and we must realize that we no longer need to become something new, as we are all in possession of all the qualities that we have been pursuing so far in our dreams.</p>\n<p>We must make efforts to be present at every moment of our life. That Presence shall bring alert Consciousness back to our life. In the state of alert Consciousness thoughts will no longer keep our attention in captivity, and we may experience silence. In the alert silence we recognize that it is <a href=\"https://egoalertnessconsciousness.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/12-keys-to-access-the-deeper-dimensions-of-life/\">our real Self </a>is, it is our real inner nature. Enlightenment is us, we ourselves.</p>\n<p>~From the book: <a href=\"http://powerofconsciousness.blogspot.hu/\">Frank M.

While that’s not </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">technically</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> true, there is some merit to what’s being said, but not for the reasons you might think.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As humans, each and every one of us carries with them an ‘energy.’ We have multiple energies, one of them being our sexual energy or intimate energy. Whenever we’re intimate with another person, these intimate energies of each person [become merged or even absorbed by the other](http://allietheiss.com/sharing-intimate-energy/).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, if you sleep with people who are full of positive, loving energy, you absorb that energy, and it brings you up.

Use energy-based aura meditation to regularly cleanse your energetic being, just as you would take a shower or brush your teeth.</span>\n\n**Aura healings**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we need an aura healing, we seek out a healer who will help you cast away any unwanted energies. These healers are people who will help restore your flow of energy by removing any blockages. Reiki is one form of aura healing that is effective and popular in many areas.</span>\n\n**Aura readings**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between our own energies and foreign energies we’ve obtained from elsewhere. An aura reader will assist you in picking out which energies are yours and which ones you need to get rid of. Recognizing which energies are your own is important for getting rid of the right ones.</span>\n\n**Accept your emotions, and then express them**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we have emotional energy that does not get released or channeled in a proper way, it can create a blockage in our spiritual energy system. When this happens, unwanted energies get trapped inside. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To avoid this, make sure you’re truly feeling any emotions that have hid themselves away. When we let ourselves experience these hidden emotions, we release that energy, which helps keep our systems flowing healthily.</span>\n\n**Other methods**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other practices that will help clean your aura, in addition to the four listed above, include:</span>\n\n- **Bathing in Epsom salt**<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which helps stimulate energy flow and the removal of minor psychic debris.</span>\n- **Swimming**<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

They enjoy manipulating those around them until they get exactly what they want, and most of them carry with them an arsenal of different tricks and tactics to keep us engaged, but second-guessing ourselves.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One tactic the clever narcissist will use on unsuspecting people they wish to take advantage of is called ‘**[intermittent reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement)**.’ Intermittent reinforcement is a psychological phenomena used by casinos and animal trainers to produce certain desired behaviors.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermittent reinforcement, according to </span>**[*Out of the Fog*](http://outofthefog.website/what-not-to-do-1/2015/12/3/intermittent-reinforcement)**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, can be defined like this:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Intermittent Reinforcement is when rules, rewards or personal boundaries are handed out or enforced inconsistently and occasionally. This usually encourages another person to keep pushing until they get what they want from you without changing their own behavior.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you own a dog and 90 percent of the time you never give it leftover food or scraps, but every now and then you cave and toss him or her a little treat, you reinforce their behavior of begging, because now they know that, while they might not get a treat </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every time</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they do sometimes, so it’s worth trying every time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can also be seen in casinos. Gamblers know that they’re not going to win a huge sum of money with every hand played or with every pull of a slot machine, but they know that eventually they have to win something because that’s just how the numbers work.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narcissists use this same psychological principle to reel people in and keep them hooked. They know what people like to hear, so just as you decide you’re done with them and want to move on, they’ll toss you a bit of the validation you were so desperately seeking from them, just to keep you interested. This is how they keep you engaged in a relationship that largely only benefits them, and not you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reel you in, the narcissist will suffocate you with an almost overwhelming amount of flattery and compliments. They want you to feel as though they are genuinely interested in you so that you open up to them on a vulnerable level. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once this happens, you’ll notice they change almost immediately. Once they’ve made it into your world, everything they once told you they loved about you become your most noticeable vices and flaws. They want you to be miserable because they’re miserable and need company. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll see them try to throw out some intermittent reinforcement as soon as you try to leave this toxic relationship, pulling </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 180 by claiming they’re your biggest fan.

                "markdown": "\nJohn D. (Jack) Mayer states that “Emotions operate two major levels; physical and psychological.  Dr. Maurice Elias on the other hand, says, “Emotions are human beings’ warning systems as to what is really going on around them.  In other words, they act as an indicator of how things are going on in one’s lives. Emotions help by keeping us in check to make sure that we are not only controlled by our mental reasoning. Emotions control thinking, actions and behavior. A person who suppresses their emotions are not healthy beings and are subjecting themselves to physical illness. There are two types of emotions; positive and negative. Negative emotions are the ones that cause emotional pain and they include; frustration, fear, negativity etc.\n\n### 1. Open Up\n\nThe first step to express your emotional pain is to open up. You can choose to open up to a counselor or someone close to you. But while at it, you need to keep an open mind to the person you are talking to. This will enable the counselor to understand you better on where the negativity is coming from. You should also ask for feedback to check up on your progress.\n\n### 2. Learn How to Monitor Your Feelings\n\n- Allow yourself to feel your emotions.\n\nYou do not necessarily have to bury your feelings or ignore them as this will only cause you more and more pain and damage to your body. Instead, you have to express the pain. You can express the pain through various channels.\n\n- Stop being so negative\n\nYou should monitor your internal dialogue to keep out negative emotions from your mind. Instead of telling yourself how terrible a situation is, you can be more positive by telling yourself how you are in a bad situation but you will get over it. You should also rationalize your mind to know that getting angry won’t solve anything for you.\n\n- Watch yourself as you talk to others\n\nOnce you have gained control of your emotions, you should watch how you talk to others and restraint yourself from uttering negative words that will only serve to frustrate or anger you. Take time and think whether you would like to be told whatever you are telling other people. You should also own up to certain things. You should not sound accusatory when you express your emotions to others.

Learn to Manage Your Emotions Physically\n\n- Engage in Exercise\n\nExercise is a very effective way of dealing with negative emotions. Slow exercises such as yoga help one to relax. When done regularly, exercise calms down a distressed soul. In addition, it is good for your physical fitness, your heart, and emotional wellbeing. You can also take a nice walk in nature to relax the body.\n\n- Develop relaxation techniques.\n\nThere are several relaxation techniques such as; listening to slow music and deep-breathing exercises. [Inspiring Quotes](http://expandedconsciousness.com/2016/07/29/31-powerful-quotes-inspire-times-loneliness/) are a great way to comfort your emotions in times of loneliness.\n\n- Meditation\n\nTo meditate, sit in a relaxed, comfortable position with both feet on the ground then close your eyes. Take deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly and gently for at least 10 minutes. Once you are completely relaxed, you can feel your heart and imagine yourself somewhere relaxing.  Stay with this feeling for as long as you can.  Over time, meditation will cleanse out the negative emotions from your body.\n\n### 4. Expressing Feelings Through Creativity\n\n- Use of Art\n\nArt therapy is a useful way to express emotions. Art therapy provides an individual with an opportunity channel their feelings on a piece of paper on any other writing material, like a canvass. There are many types of art one can engage in and eventually develop it into a hobby. For example, one can paint, sing, play a musical instrument, dancing or even collecting antique pieces of art.\n\n- Keep a Journal\n\nWriting about what you feel can help you understand what triggered the negative emotions and help you understand yourself better. In this way, instead of reacting negatively, you channel all the anger, hurt or fears into a book. This journal when taken to counseling sessions, will help your counselor to get an honest view of your feelings and understand the situation you are in better. Here are a number of [great writing tips](http://writingdaddy.com/blog/6-tips-from-writers) to help you get along.\n\n### 5. Alienate Yourself from the Situation\n\nOnce you have identified your emotions and realized whatever is causing you emotional pain, you need to alienate yourself from the situation and the emotion. For example, if there are certain friends pressurizing you to engage in acts that are against your beliefs and have refused to understand you, you can simply stop associating with them.\n\n### 6. Prayer\n\nWhen all efforts to let go of negative emotions fails, then we can always resort to prayer. I’m not saying it’s the last thing you should do, but you can do it concurrently with the other exercises. Pray to God and ask Him to deliver you from the clutches of whatever it is that is holding you back. Many people have testified how prayers helped them in their darkest parts of the lives and most likely it is going work for you too.\n\n \n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div>\n",
